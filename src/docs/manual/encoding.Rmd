# Character Encoding

## Content Characters

The content of a Stan program must be coded in ASCII.  All identifiers
must consist of only ASCII alpha-numeric characters and the underscore
character.  All arithmetic operators and punctuation must be coded in
ASCII.

### Compatibility with Latin-1 and UTF-8 {-}

The UTF-8 encoding of Unicode and the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding
share the first 128 code points with ASCII and thus cannot be
distinguished from ASCII.  That means you can set editors, etc., to
use UTF-8 or Latin-1 (or the other Latin-n variants) without worrying
that the content of a Stan program will be destroyed.

## Comment Characters

Any bytes on a line after a line-comment sequence (`//` or
`#`) are ignored up until the ASCII newline character
(`\n`).  They may thus be written in any character encoding which
is convenient.

Any content after a block comment open sequence in ASCII (`/*`)
up to the closing block comment (`*/`) is ignored, and thus may
also be written in whatever character set is convenient.
