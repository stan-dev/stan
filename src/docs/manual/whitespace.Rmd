# Whitespace 

## Whitespace Characters 

The whitespace characters (and their ASCII code points) are the space
(0x20), tab (0x09), carriage return (0x0D), and line feed (0x0A).

## Whitespace Neutrality 

Stan treats all whitespace characters identically.  Specifically,
there is no significance to indentation, to tabs, to carriage returns
or line feeds, or to any vertical alignment of text.  Any whitespace
character is exchangeable with any other.  

Other than for readability, the number of whitespaces is also
irrelevant.  One or more whitespace characters of any type are
treated identically by the parser.


## Whitespace Location 

Zero or more whitespace characters may be placed between symbols in a
Stan program.  For example, zero or more whitespace characters of any
variety may be included before and after a binary operation such as
`a * b`, before a statement-ending semicolon, around parentheses
or brackets, before or after commas separating function arguments,
etc.

Identifiers and literals may not be separated by whitespace.  Thus it
is not legal to write the number `10000` as `10 000` or to
write the identifier `normal_lpdf` as `normal _ lpdf`.
