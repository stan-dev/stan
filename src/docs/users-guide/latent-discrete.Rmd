# Latent Discrete Parameters  {#latent-discrete.chapter}

Stan does not support sampling discrete parameters.  So it is not
possible to directly translate BUGS or JAGS models with discrete
parameters (i.e., discrete stochastic nodes).  Nevertheless, it is
possible to code many models that involve bounded discrete
parameters by marginalizing out the discrete parameters.^[The computations are similar to those involved in expectation maximization (EM) algorithms @dempster-et-al:1977.]

This chapter shows how to code several widely-used models involving
latent discrete parameters.  The next chapter, the [clustering
chapter](#clustering.chapter), on clustering models, considers further
models involving latent discrete parameters.

## The Benefits of Marginalization {#rao-blackwell.section}

Although it requires some algebra on the joint probability function,
a pleasant byproduct of the required calculations is the posterior
expectation of the marginalized variable, which is often the quantity
of interest for a model.  This allows far greater exploration of the
tails of the distribution as well as more efficient sampling on an
iteration-by-iteration basis because the expectation at all possible
values is being used rather than itself being estimated through
sampling a discrete parameter.

Standard optimization algorithms, including expectation maximization
(EM), are often provided in applied statistics papers to describe
maximum likelihood estimation algorithms.  Such derivations provide
exactly the marginalization needed for coding the model in Stan.

## Change Point Models {#change-point.section}

The first example is a model of coal mining disasters in the U.K. for the years 1851--1962.^[The source of the data is @Jarret:1979, which itself is a note correcting an earlier data collection.]


### Model with Latent Discrete Parameter {-}

[@PyMC:2014 Section 3.1] provides a Poisson model of disaster
$D_t$ in year $t$ with two rate parameters, an early rate ($e$)
and late rate ($l$), that change at a given point in time $s$.  The
full model expressed using a latent discrete parameter $s$ is

$$
e  \sim  \mathsf{Exponential}(r_e)
\\
l  \sim  \mathsf{Exponential}(r_l)
\\
s \sim  \mathsf{Uniform}(1, T)
\\
D_t \sim  \mathsf{Poisson}(t < s \ ? \ e \ : \ l)
$$

The last line uses the conditional operator (also known as the ternary
operator), which is borrowed from C and related languages.  The
conditional operator has the same behavior as its counterpart in C++.^[The R counterpart, `ifelse`, is slightly different in that it is typically used in a vectorized situation.  The conditional operator is not (yet) vectorized in Stan.]

It uses a compact notation involving separating its three arguments by
a question mark (`?`) and a colon (`:`).  The conditional
operator is defined by

$$
c \ ? \ x_1 \ : \ x_2
=
\begin{cases}
\ x_1 & \mbox{if } c \mbox{ is true (i.e., non-zero), and}
\\
\ x_2 & \mbox{if } c \mbox{ is false (i.e., zero).}
\end{cases}
$$
As of version 2.10, Stan supports the conditional operator.


### Marginalizing out the Discrete Parameter {-}

To code this model in Stan, the discrete parameter $s$ must be
marginalized out to produce a model defining the log of the
probability function $p(e,l,D_t)$.  The full joint probability factors
as

$$
p(e,l,s,D)
 =  p(e) \, p(l) \, p(s) \, p(D | s, e, l)
\\
 = 
\mathsf{Exponential}(e|r_e) \ \mathsf{Exponential}(l|r_l) \
\mathsf{Uniform}(s|1, T)
\prod_{t=1}^T \mathsf{Poisson}(D_t | t < s \ ? \ e \ : \ l),
$$


To marginalize, an alternative factorization into prior and likelihood
is used,

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
p(e,l,D) & = & p(e,l) \, p(D|e,l),
\end{array}
$$

where the likelihood is defined by marginalizing $s$ as

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
p(D | e,l)
& = &
\sum_{s=1}^T p(s, D | e,l)
\\[3pt]
& = &
\sum_{s=1}^T p(s) p(D | s,e,l)
\\[3pt]
& = &
\sum_{s=1}^T \mathsf{Uniform}(s | 1,T)
\, \prod_{t=1}^T \mathsf{Poisson}(D_t | t < s \ ? \ e \ : \ l)
\end{array}
$$

Stan operates on the log scale and thus requires the log likelihood,

$$
\log p(D | e,l) =
\mbox{log\_sum\_exp}_{s=1}^T
(
 \log \mathsf{Uniform}(s \, | \, 1, T)
+ \sum_{t=1}^T \log \mathsf{Poisson}(D_t \, | \, t < s \ ?
\ e \ : \ l) ),
$$

where the log sum of exponents function is defined by
$$
\mbox{log\_sum\_exp}_{n=1}^N \, \alpha_n
\ = \
\log \sum_{n=1}^N \mbox{exp}(\alpha_n).
$$

The log sum of exponents function allows the model to be coded
directly in Stan using the built-in function `log_sum_exp`,
which provides both arithmetic stability and efficiency for mixture
model calculations.


### Coding the Model in Stan {-}

The Stan program for the change point model is shown in
the figure below.  The transformed parameter
`lp[s]` stores the quantity $\log p(s, D \, | \, e, l)$.

```
data {
  real<lower=0> r_e;
  real<lower=0> r_l;

  int<lower=1> T;
  int<lower=0> D[T];
}
transformed data {
  real log_unif;
  log_unif = -log(T);
}
parameters {
  real<lower=0> e;
  real<lower=0> l;
}
transformed parameters {
  vector[T] lp;
  lp = rep_vector(log_unif, T);
  for (s in 1:T)
    for (t in 1:T)
      lp[s] = lp[s] + poisson_lpmf(D[t] | t < s ? e : l);
}
model {
  e ~ exponential(r_e);
  l ~ exponential(r_l);
  target += log_sum_exp(lp);
}
```
id:change-point-model.figure

A change point model in which disaster rates `D[t]` have one rate,
`e`, before the change point and a different rate, `l`, after the
change point.  The change point itself, `s`, is marginalized out as
described in the text.



Although the change-point model is coded directly, the doubly nested
loop used for `s` and `t` is quadratic in `T`.  Luke Wiklendt pointed
out that a linear alternative can be achieved by the use of dynamic
programming similar to the forward-backward algorithm for Hidden
Markov models; he submitted a slight variant of the following code to
replace the transformed parameters block of the above Stan program.

```
transformed parameters {
    vector[T] lp;
    {
      vector[T + 1] lp_e;
      vector[T + 1] lp_l;
      lp_e[1] = 0;
      lp_l[1] = 0;
      for (t in 1:T) {
        lp_e[t + 1] = lp_e[t] + poisson_lpmf(D[t] | e);
        lp_l[t + 1] = lp_l[t] + poisson_lpmf(D[t] | l);
      }
      lp = rep_vector(log_unif + lp_l[T + 1], T)
           + head(lp_e, T) - head(lp_l, T);
    }
  }
```

As should be obvious from looking at it, it has linear complexity in
`T` rather than quadratic.  The result for the mining-disaster
data is about 20 times faster;  the improvement will be greater for
larger `T`.

The key to understanding Wiklendt's dynamic programming version is to
see that `head(lp_e)` holds the forward values, whereas
`lp_l[T + 1] - head(lp_l, T)` holds the backward values; the
clever use of subtraction allows `lp_l` to be accumulated
naturally in the forward direction.


### Fitting the Model with MCMC {-}

This model is easy to fit using MCMC with NUTS in its default
configuration.  Convergence is  fast and sampling produces roughly
one effective sample every two iterations.  Because it is a relatively
small model (the inner double loop over time is roughly 20,000 steps),
it is  fast.

The value of `lp` for each iteration for each change point is
available because it is declared as a transformed parameter.  If the
value of `lp` were not of interest, it could be coded as a local
variable in the model block and thus avoid the I/O overhead of saving
values every iteration.

### Posterior Distribution of the Discrete Change Point {-}

The value of `lp[s]` in a given iteration is given by $\log
p(s,D|e,l)$ for the values of the early and late rates, $e$ and $l$,
in the iteration.  In each iteration after convergence, the early and
late disaster rates, $e$ and $l$, are drawn from the posterior
$p(e,l|D)$ by MCMC sampling and the associated `lp` calculated.
The value of `lp` may be normalized to calculate $p(s|e,l,D)$ in
each iteration, based on on the current values of $e$ and $l$.
Averaging over iterations provides an unnormalized probability
estimate of the change point being $s$ (see below for the normalizing
constant),

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
p(s | D)
& \propto &
q(s | D)
\\[3pt]
& = &
\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \exp(`lp`[m,s]).
\end{array}
$$

where $\mbox{lp}[m,s]$ represents the value of `lp` in
posterior draw $m$ for change point $s$.  By averaging over draws,
$e$ and $l$ are themselves marginalized out, and the result has no
dependence on a given iteration's value for $e$ and $l$.  A final
normalization then produces the quantity of interest, the posterior
probability of the change point being $s$ conditioned on the data $D$,

$$
p(s | D)
=
\frac{q(s|D)}{\sum_{s'=1}^T q(s' | D)}.
$$

A plot of the values of $\log p(s|D)$ computed using Stan 2.4's
default MCMC implementation is shown in the posterior plot.

Log probability of change point being in year, calculated analytically.

points.

id:change-point-posterior.figure

In order their range of estimates be visible, the first plot is on the log
scale and the second plot on the linear scale; note the narrower range
of years in the right-hand plot resulting from sampling. The posterior
mean of $s$ is roughly 1891.


### Discrete Sampling {-}

The generated quantities block may be used to draw discrete parameter
values using the built-in pseudo-random number generators.  For
example, with `lp` defined as above, the following program
draws a random value for `s` at every iteration.

```
generated quantities {
  int<lower=1,upper=T> s;
  s = categorical_logit_rng(lp);
}
```

A posterior histogram of draws for $s$ is shown on the second change
point posterior figure above.

Compared to working in terms of expectations, discrete sampling is
highly inefficient, especially for tails of distributions, so this
approach should only be used if draws from a distribution are
explicitly required.   Otherwise, expectations should be computed in
the generated quantities block based on the posterior distribution for
`s` given by `softmax(lp)`.


### Posterior Covariance {-}

The discrete sample generated for $s$ can be used to calculate
covariance with other parameters.  Although the sampling approach is
straightforward, it is more statistically efficient (in the sense of
requiring far fewer iterations for the same degree of accuracy) to
calculate these covariances in expectation using `lp`.


### Multiple Change Points {-}

There is no obstacle in principle to allowing multiple change points.
The only issue is that computation increases from linear to quadratic
in marginalizing out two change points, cubic for three change points,
and so on.  There are three parameters, `e`, `m`, and
`l`, and two loops for the change point and then one over time,
with log densities being stored in a matrix.

```
matrix[T, T] lp;
lp = rep_matrix(log_unif, T);
for (s1 in 1:T)
  for (s2 in 1:T)
    for (t in 1:T)
      lp[s1,s2] = lp[s1,s2]
        + poisson_lpmf(D[t] | t < s1 ? e : (t < s2 ? m : l));
```

The matrix can then be converted back to a vector using
`to_vector` before being passed to `log_sum_exp`.

## Mark-Recapture Models

A widely applied field method in ecology is to capture (or sight)
animals, mark them (e.g., by tagging), then release them.  This
process is then repeated one or more times, and is often done for
populations on an ongoing basis.  The resulting data may be used to
estimate population size.

The first subsection describes a  simple mark-recapture model that does
not involve any latent discrete parameters.  The following subsections
describes the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, which involves latent
discrete parameters for animal death.

### Simple Mark-Recapture Model {-}

In the simplest case, a one-stage mark-recapture study produces the
following data


* $M$ : number of animals marked in first capture,
* $C$ : number animals in second capture, and
* $R$ : number of marked animals in second capture.


The estimand of interest is


* $N$ : number of animals in the population.


Despite the notation, the model will take $N$ to be a continuous
parameter; just because the population must be finite doesn't mean the
parameter representing it must be.  The parameter will be used to
produce a real-valued estimate of the population size.

The Lincoln-Petersen [@Lincoln:1930,@Petersen:1896] method for
estimating population size is

$$
\hat{N} = \frac{M C}{R}.
$$

This population estimate would arise from a probabilistic model in
which the number of recaptured animals is distributed binomially,
$$
R \sim \mathsf{Binomial}(C, M / N)
$$
given the total number of animals captured in the second round ($C$)
with a recapture probability of $M/N$, the fraction of the total
population $N$ marked in the first round.



```
data {
  int<lower=0> M;
  int<lower=0> C;
  int<lower=0,upper=min(M,C)> R;
}
parameters {
  real<lower=(C - R + M)> N;
}
model {
  R ~ binomial(C, M / N);
}
```
id:lincoln-petersen-model.figure

A probabilistic formulation of the Lincoln-Petersen
estimator for population size based on data from a one-step
mark-recapture study.  The lower bound on $N$ is necessary to
efficiently eliminate impossible values.

The probabilistic variant of the Lincoln-Petersen estimator can be
directly coded in Stan as shown in the Lincon-Petersen model figure. 
The Lincoln-Petersen estimate is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)
for this model.

To ensure the MLE is the Lincoln-Petersen estimate, an improper
uniform prior for $N$ is used; this could (and should) be replaced
with a more informative prior if possible based on knowledge of the
population under study.

The one tricky part of the model is the lower bound $C - R + M$ placed
on the population size $N$.  Values below this bound are impossible
because it is otherwise not possible to draw $R$ samples out of the
$C$ animals recaptured.  Implementing this lower bound is necessary to
ensure sampling and optimization can be carried out in an
unconstrained manner with unbounded support for parameters on the
transformed (unconstrained) space.  The lower bound in the declaration
for $C$ implies a variable transform
$f : (C-R+M,\infty) \rightarrow (-\infty,+\infty)$ defined by
$f(N) = \log(N - (C - R + M))$; the reference manual contains full
details of all constrained parameter transforms.

### Cormack-Jolly-Seber with Discrete Parameter {-}

The Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model
[@Cormack:1964; Jolly:1965; Seber:1965] is an open-population model
in which the population may change over time due to death; the
presentation here draws heavily on @Schofield:2007.

The basic data are


* $I$: number of individuals,
* $T$: number of capture periods, and
* $y_{i,t}$: Boolean indicating if individual $i$ was captured at
  time $t$.


Each individual is assumed to have been captured at least once because
an individual only contributes information conditionally after they
have been captured the first time.

There are two Bernoulli parameters in the model,


* $\phi_t$ : probability that animal alive at time $t$ survives
  until $t + 1$ and
* $p_t$ : probability that animal alive at time $t$ is captured at
  time $t$.


These parameters will both be given uniform priors, but information
should be used to tighten these priors in practice.

The CJS model also employs a latent discrete parameter $z_{i,t}$
indicating for each individual $i$ whether it is alive at time $t$,
distributed as

$$
z_{i,t} \sim \mathsf{Bernoulli}(z_{i,t-1} \ ? \ 0 \ : \ \phi_{t-1}).
$$

The conditional prevents the model positing zombies; once an animal is
dead, it stays dead.  The data distribution is then simple to express
conditional on $z$ as

$$
_{i,t} \sim \mathsf{Bernoulli}(z_{i,t} \ ? \ 0 \ : \ p_t).
$$

The conditional enforces the constraint that dead animals cannot be captured.


### Collective Cormack-Jolly-Seber Model {-}

This subsection presents an implementation of the model in terms of
counts for different history profiles for individuals over three
capture times. It assumes exchangeability of the animals in that each
is assigned the same capture and survival probabilities.

In order to ease the marginalization of the latent discrete parameter
$z_{i,t}$, the Stan models rely on a derived quantity $\chi_t$ for
the probability that an individual is never captured again if it is
alive at time $t$ (if it is dead, the recapture probability is zero).
this quantity is defined recursively by
$$
\chi_t
=
\begin{cases}
1
& \mbox{if } t = T
\\[3pt]
(1 - \phi_t) + \phi_t (1 - p_{t+1}) \chi_{t+1}
& \mbox{ if } t < T
\end{cases}
$$

The base case arises because if an animal was captured in the last
time period, the probability it is never captured again is 1 because
there are no more capture periods.  The recursive case defining
$\chi_{t}$ in terms of $\chi_{t+1}$ involves two possibilities: (1)
not surviving to the next time period, with probability $(1 -
\phi_t)$, or (2) surviving to the next time period with probability
$\phi_t$, not being captured in the next time period with probability
$(1 - p_{t+1})$, and not being captured again after being alive in
period $t+1$ with probability $\chi_{t+1}$.

With three capture times, there are three captured/not-captured
profiles an individual may have.  These may be naturally coded as
binary numbers as follows.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c}
& \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{{\it captures}}
\\
{\it profile} & 1 & 2 & 3 & {\it probability}
\\ \hline
{0} & - & - & - & n/a
\\
{1} & - & - & + & n/a
\\ \hline
{2} & - & + & - & $\chi_2$
\\
{3} & - & + & + & $\phi_2 \, p_3$
\\ \hline
{4} & + & - & - & $\chi_1$
\\
{5} & + & - & + & $\phi_1 \, (1 - p_2) \, \phi_2 \, p_3$
\\ \hline
{6} & + & + & - & $ \phi_1 \, p_2 \, \chi_2$
\\
{7} & + & + & + & $\phi_1 \, p_2 \, \phi_2 \, p_3$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

History 0, for animals that are never captured, is unobservable
because only animals that are captured are observed. History 1, for
animals that are only captured in the last round, provides no
information for the CJS model, because capture/non-capture status is
only informative when conditioned on earlier captures.  For the
remaining cases, the contribution to the likelihood is provided in the
final column.

By defining these probabilities in terms of $\chi$ directly, there is
no need for a latent binary parameter indicating whether an animal is
alive at time $t$ or not.  The definition of $\chi$ is typically used
to define the likelihood (i.e., marginalize out the latent discrete
parameter) for the CJS model [@Schofield:2007, page 9].
[@an model de; @ines $\chi$ as a trans]ormed parameter based on
para@$\phi$ and p$.  In the model block, the log probability is
incremented for each history based on its count.  This second step is
similar to collecting Bernoulli observations into a binomial or
categorical observations into a multinomial, only it is coded directly
in the Stan program using `target~+=` rather than
being part of a built-in probability function.

#### Identifiability {-}

The parameters $\phi_2$ and $p_3$, the probability of death at time 2
and probability of capture at time 3 are not identifiable, because both
may be used to account for lack of capture at time 3.  Their product,
$\beta_3 = \phi_2 \, p_3$, is identified.  The Stan model defines
`beta3` as a generated quantity.  Unidentified parameters pose a
problem for Stan's samplers' adaptation.  Although the problem posed
for adaptation is mild here because the parameters are bounded and
thus have proper uniform priors, it would be better to formulate an
identified parameterization.  One way to do this would be to formulate
a hierarchical model for the $p$ and $\phi$ parameters.

### Individual Cormack-Jolly-Seber Model {-}

This section presents a version of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model
cast at the individual level rather than collectively as in the
previous subsection.  It also extends the model to allow an arbitrary
number of time periods.  The data will consist of the number $T$ of
capture events, the number $I$ of individuals, and a boolean flag
$y_{i,t}$ indicating if individual $i$ was observed at time $t$.  In
Stan,

```
data {
  int<lower=2> T;
  int<lower=0> I;
  int<lower=0,upper=1> y[I, T];
}
```

The advantages to the individual-level model is that it becomes
possible to add individual "random effects" that affect survival or
capture probability, as well as to avoid the combinatorics involved in
unfolding $2^T$ observation histories for $T$ capture times.

#### Utility Functions {-}

The individual CJS model is written involves several function
definitions.  The first two are used in the transformed data block to
compute the first and last time period in which an animal was
captured.^[An alternative would be to compute this on the outside and feed it into the Stan model as preprocessed data.  Yet another alternative encoding would be a sparse one recording only the capture events along with their time and identifying the individual captured.]

```
functions {
  int first_capture(int[] y_i) {
    for (k in 1:size(y_i))
      if (y_i[k])
        return k;
    return 0;
  }
  int last_capture(int[] y_i) {
    for (k_rev in 0:(size(y_i) - 1)) {
      int k;
      k = size(y_i) - k_rev;
      if (y_i[k])
        return k;
    }
    return 0;
  }
  ...
}
```

These two functions are used to define the first and last capture time
for each individual in the transformed data block.^[Both functions return 0 if the individual represented by the input array was never captured.  Individuals with no captures are not relevant for estimating the model because all probability statements are conditional on earlier captures.  Typically they would be removed from the data, but the program allows them to be included even though they make not contribution to the log probability function.]

```
transformed data {
  int<lower=0,upper=T> first[I];
  int<lower=0,upper=T> last[I];
  vector<lower=0,upper=I>[T] n_captured;
  for (i in 1:I)
    first[i] = first_capture(y[i]);
  for (i in 1:I)
    last[i] = last_capture(y[i]);
  n_captured = rep_vector(0, T);
  for (t in 1:T)
    for (i in 1:I)
      if (y[i, t])
        n_captured[t] = n_captured[t] + 1;
}
```

The transformed data block also defines `n_captured[t]`, which is
the total number of captures at time `t`.  The variable
`n_captured` is defined as a vector instead of an integer array
so that it can be used in an elementwise vector operation in the generated
quantities block to model the population estimates at each time point.

The parameters and transformed parameters are as before, but now there
is a function definition for computing the entire vector `chi`, the
probability that if an individual is alive at `t` that it will
never be captured again.

```
parameters {
  vector<lower=0,upper=1>[T-1] phi;
  vector<lower=0,upper=1>[T] p;
}
transformed parameters {
  vector<lower=0,upper=1>[T] chi;
  chi = prob_uncaptured(T,p,phi);
}
```

The definition of `prob_uncaptured`, from the functions block,
is

```
functions {
  ...
  vector prob_uncaptured(int T, vector p, vector phi) {
    vector[T] chi;
    chi[T] = 1.0;
    for (t in 1:(T - 1)) {
      int t_curr;
      int t_next;
      t_curr = T - t;
      t_next = t_curr + 1;
      chi[t_curr] = (1 - phi[t_curr])
                     + phi[t_curr]
                       * (1 - p[t_next])
                       * chi[t_next];
    }
    return chi;
  }
}
```

The function definition directly follows the mathematical definition
of $\chi_t$, unrolling the recursion into an iteration and
defining the elements of `chi` from `T` down to 1.

#### The Model {-}

Given the precomputed quantities, the model block directly encodes the
CJS model's log likelihood function.  All parameters are left with
their default uniform priors and the model simply encodes the log
probability of the observations `q` given the parameters `p`
and `phi` as well as the transformed parameter `chi` defined
in terms of `p` and `phi`.

```
model {
  for (i in 1:I) {
    if (first[i] > 0) {
      for (t in (first[i]+1):last[i]) {
        1 ~ bernoulli(phi[t-1]);
        y[i, t] ~ bernoulli(p[t]);
      }
      1 ~ bernoulli(chi[last[i]]);
    }
  }
}
```

The outer loop is over individuals, conditional skipping individuals
`i` which are never captured.  The never-captured check depends
on the convention of the first-capture and last-capture functions
returning 0 for `first` if an individual is never captured.

The inner loop for individual `i` first increments the log
probability based on the survival of the individual with probability
`phi[t-1]`.  The outcome of 1 is fixed because the individual
must survive between the first and last capture (i.e., no zombies).
The loop starts after the first capture, because all
information in the CJS model is conditional on the first capture.

In the inner loop, the observed capture status `y[i,~t]` for
individual `i` at time `t` has a Bernoulli distribution
based on the capture probability `p[t]` at time `t`.

After the inner loop, the probability of an animal never being seen
again after being observed at time `last[i]` is included, because
`last[i]` was defined to be the last time period in which animal
`i` was observed.

#### Identified Parameters {-}

As with the collective model described in the previous subsection,
this model does not identify `phi[T-1]` and `p[T]`, but
does identify their product, `beta`.  Thus `beta` is defined
as a generated quantity to monitor convergence and report.

```
generated quantities {
  real beta;
  ...

  beta = phi[T-1] * p[T];
  ...
}
```


The parameter `p[1]` is also not modeled and will just be uniform
between 0 and 1.  A more finely articulated model might have a
hierarchical or time-series component, in which case `p[1]` would
be an unknown initial condition and both `phi[T-1]` and
`p[T]` could be identified.

#### Population Size Estimates {-}

The generated quantities also calculates an estimate of the population
mean at each time `t` in the same way as in the simple
mark-recapture model as the number of individuals captured at time
`t` divided by the probability of capture at time `t`.  This
is done with the elementwise division operation for vectors
(`./`) in the generated quantities block.

```
generated quantities {
  ...
  vector<lower=0>[T] pop;
  ...
  pop = n_captured ./ p;
  pop[1] = -1;
}
```

#### Generalizing to Individual Effects {-}

All individuals are modeled as having the same capture probability,
but this model could be easily generalized to use a logistic
regression here based on individual-level inputs to be used as
predictors.



## Data Coding and Diagnostic Accuracy Models

Although seemingly disparate tasks, the rating/coding/annotation of
items with categories and diagnostic testing for disease or other
conditions share several characteristics which allow their statistical
properties to modeled similarly.

### Diagnostic Accuracy {-}

Suppose you have diagnostic tests for a condition of varying
sensitivity and specificity.  Sensitivity is the probability a test
returns positive when the patient has the condition and specificity is
the probability that a test returns negative when the patient does not
have the condition.  For example, mammograms and puncture biopsy tests
both test for the presence of breast cancer.  Mammograms have high
sensitivity and low specificity, meaning lots of false positives,
whereas puncture biopsies are the opposite, with low sensitivity and
high specificity, meaning lots of false negatives.

There are several estimands of interest in such studies.  An
epidemiological study may be interested in the prevalence of a kind of
infection, such as malaria, in a population.  A test development study
might be interested in the diagnostic accuracy of a new test. A health
care worker performing tests might be interested in the disease status
of a particular patient.

### Data Coding {-}

Humans are often given the task of coding (equivalently rating or
annotating) data.  For example, journal or grant reviewers rate
submissions, a political study may code campaign commercials as to
whether they are attack ads or not, a natural language processing
study might annotate Tweets as to whether they are positive or
negative in overall sentiment, or a dentist looking at an X-ray
classifies a patient as having a cavity or not.  In all of these
cases, the data coders play the role of the diagnostic tests and all
of the same estimands are in play --- data coder accuracy and bias,
true categories of items being coded, or the prevalence of various
categories of items in the data.

### Noisy Categorical Measurement Model {-}

In this section, only categorical ratings are considered, and the
challenge in the modeling for Stan is to marginalize out the discrete
parameters.

@DawidSkene:1979 introduce a noisy-measurement model for
[@ding and ap; @ly in the epidemiologi]al setting of coding what
doct@s say aboutpatient histories;  the same model can be used
for diagnostic procedures.

#### Data {-}

The data for the model consists of $J$ raters (diagnostic tests), $I$
items (patients), and $K$ categories (condition statuses) to annotate,
with $y_{i, j} \in 1{:}K$ being the rating provided by rater $j$ for
item $i$.  In a diagnostic test setting for a particular condition,
the raters are diagnostic procedures and often $K=2$, with values
signaling the presence or absence of the condition.^[Diagnostic procedures are often ordinal, as in stages of cancer in oncological diagnosis or the severity of a cavity in dental diagnosis.  Dawid and Skene's model may be used as is or naturally generalized for ordinal ratings using a latent continuous rating and cutpoints as in ordinal logistic regression.]

It is relatively straightforward to extend Dawid and Skene's model to
deal with the situation where not every rater rates each item exactly
once.

### Model Parameters {-}

The model is based on three parameters, the first of which is discrete:


* $z_i$ : a value in $1{:}K$ indicating the true category of item $i$,
* $\pi$ : a $K$-simplex for the prevalence of the $K$
  categories in the population, and
* $\theta_{j,k}$ : a $K$-simplex for the response of annotator $j$
  to an item of true category $k$.


### Noisy Measurement Model {-}

The true category of an item is assumed to be generated by a simple
categorical distribution based on item prevalence,
$$
z_i \sim \mathsf{Categorical}(\pi).
$$

The rating $y_{i, j}$ provided for item $i$ by rater $j$ is modeled as
a categorical response of rater $i$ to an item of category $z_i$,^[In the subscript, $z[i]$ is written as $z_i$ to
  improve legibility.]

$$
y_{i, j} \sim \mathsf{Categorical}(\theta_{j,\pi_{z[i]}}).
$$

#### Priors and Hierarchical Modeling {-}

Dawid and Skene provided maximum likelihood estimates for $\theta$ and
$\pi$, which allows them to generate probability estimates for each $z_i$.

To mimic Dawid and Skene's maximum likelihood model, the parameters
$\theta_{j,k}$ and $\pi$ can be given uniform priors over
$K$-simplexes.  It is straightforward to generalize to Dirichlet
priors,
$$
\pi \sim \mathsf{Dirichlet}(\alpha)
$$
and
$$
\theta_{j,k} \sim \mathsf{Dirichlet}(\beta_k)
$$
with fixed hyperparameters $\alpha$ (a vector) and $\beta$ (a matrix
or array of vectors).  The prior for $\theta_{j,k}$ must be allowed to
vary in $k$, so that, for instance, $\beta_{k,k}$ is large enough to
allow the prior to favor better-than-chance annotators over random or
adversarial ones.

Because there are $J$ coders, it would be natural to extend the model
to include a hierarchical prior for $\beta$ and to partially pool the
estimates of coder accuracy and bias.

#### Marginalizing out the True Category {-}

Because the true category parameter $z$ is discrete, it must be
marginalized out of the joint posterior in order to carry out sampling
or maximum likelihood estimation in Stan. The joint posterior factors
as
$$
p(y, \theta, \pi) = p(y | \theta,\pi) \, p(\pi) \, p(\theta),
$$
where $p(y | \theta,\pi)$ is derived by marginalizing $z$ out of

$$
p(z, y | \theta, \pi)
\ = \
\prod_{i=1}^I \left( \mathsf{Categorical}(z_i | \pi)
                     \prod_{j=1}^J
                     \mathsf{Categorical}(y_{i, j}|\theta_{j, z[i]})
              \right).
$$

This can be done item by item, with
$$
p(y | \theta, \pi)
\ = \
\prod_{i=1}^I \sum_{k=1}^K
  \left( \mathsf{Categorical}(z_i | \pi)
         \prod_{j=1}^J
         \mathsf{Categorical}(y_{i, j}|\theta_{j, z[i]})
  \right).
$$

In the missing data model, only the observed labels would be used in
the inner product.

@DawidSkene:1979 derive exactly the same equation in their
Equation~(2.7), required for the E-step in their expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm.  Stan requires the marginalized
probability function on the log scale,
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mbox{ } \ \log p(y | \theta, \pi)
\\[3pt]
\mbox{ } \  = \
\sum_{i=1}^I \log \left( \sum_{k=1}^K \exp
  \left( \log \mathsf{Categorical}(z_i | \pi)
         + \sum_{j=1}^J
         \log \mathsf{Categorical}(y_{i, j}|\theta_{j, z[i]})
  \right) \right),
\end{array}
$$
which can be directly coded using Stan's built-in `log_sum_exp`
function.


### Stan Implementation {-}

The Stan program for the Dawid and Skene model is provided below @DawidSkene:1979.

```
data {
  int<lower=2> K;
  int<lower=1> I;
  int<lower=1> J;

  int<lower=1,upper=K> y[I, J];

  vector<lower=0>[K] alpha;
  vector<lower=0>[K] beta[K];
}
parameters {
  simplex[K] pi;
  simplex[K] theta[J, K];
}
transformed parameters {
  vector[K] log_q_z[I];
  for (i in 1:I) {
    log_q_z[i] = log(pi);
    for (j in 1:J)
      for (k in 1:K)
        log_q_z[i, k] = log_q_z[i, k]
                         + log(theta[j, k, y[i, j]]);
  }
}
model {
  pi ~ dirichlet(alpha);
  for (j in 1:J)
    for (k in 1:K)
      theta[j, k] ~ dirichlet(beta[k]);

  for (i in 1:I)
    target += log_sum_exp(log_q_z[i]);
}
```
id:dawid-skene-model.figure

The model marginalizes out the discrete parameter $z$, storing the
unnormalized conditional probability $\log q(z_i=k|\theta,\pi)$ in\
`log_q_z[i,~k]`.

The Stan model converges quickly and mixes well using NUTS starting at
diffuse initial points, unlike the equivalent model implemented with
Gibbs sampling over the discrete parameter.  Reasonable weakly
informative priors are $\alpha_k = 3$ and $\beta_{k,k} = 2.5 K$ and
$\beta_{k,k'} = 1$ if $k \neq k'$.  Taking $\alpha$ and $\beta_k$ to
be unit vectors and applying optimization will produce the same answer
as the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm of
@DawidSkene:1979.

#### Inference for the True Category {-}

The quantity `log_q_z[i]` is defined as a transformed
parameter.  It encodes the (unnormalized) log of $p(z_i | \theta,
\pi)$.  Each iteration provides a value conditioned on that
iteration's values for $\theta$ and $\pi$.  Applying the softmax
function to `log_q_z[i]` provides a simplex corresponding to
the probability mass function of $z_i$ in the posterior.   These may
be averaged across the iterations to provide the posterior probability
distribution over each $z_i$.
