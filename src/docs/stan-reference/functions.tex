\chapter{Vectorization}\label{vectorization.chapter}

\noindent
Stan's scalar log probability functions all support vectorized
function application, with results defined to be the sum of the
elementwise application of the function.  In all cases, matrix
operations are faster than loops and vectorized log probability
functions are faster than their equivalent form defined with loops.

Stan also overloads the multivariate normal distribution, allowing
arrays of row vectors or vectors for the variate and location
parameter.

Stan also overloads some scalar functions, such as \code{log} and
\code{exp}, to apply to vectors (arrays) and return vectors (arrays).  
These vectorizations are defined elementwise and unlike the
probability functions, provide only minimal efficiency speedups over
repeated application and assignment in a loop.


\section{Vectorized Function Signatures}\label{prob-vectorization.section}

\subsection{Vectorized Scalar Arguments}

The normal probability function is specified with the signature
%
\begin{stancode}
normal_log(reals,reals,reals);
\end{stancode}
%
The pseudo-type \code{reals} is used to indicate that an argument
position may be vectorized.  Argument positions declared as
\code{reals} may be filled with a real, a one-dimensional array, a
vector, or a row-vector.  If there is more than one array or vector
argument, their types can be anything but their size must match.  For
instance, it is legal to use
\code{normal\_log(row\_vector,vector,real)} as long as the vector and
row vector have the same size.  

\subsection{Vectorized Vector and Row Vector Arguments}

The multivariate normal distribution accepting vector or array of
vector arguments is written as
\begin{stancode}
multi_normal_log(vectors,vectors,matrix);
\end{stancode}

\subsection{Vectorized Integer Arguments}

The pseudo-type \code{ints} is used for vectorized integer arguments.


\section{Evaluating Vectorized Functions}

The result of a vectorized log probability function is equivalent to
the sum of the evaluations on each element.  Any non-vector argument,
namely \code{real} or \code{int}, is repeated.  For instance, if
\code{y} is a vector of size \code{N}, \code{mu} is a vector of size
\code{N}, and \code{sigma} is a scalar, then
%
\begin{stancode}
ll <- normal_log(y, mu, sigma);
\end{stancode}
%
is just a more efficient way to write
%
\begin{stancode}
ll <- 0;
for (n in 1:N)
  ll <- ll + normal_log(y[n], mu[n], sigma);
\end{stancode}
%
With the same arguments, the vectorized sampling statement
%
\begin{stancode}
y ~ normal(mu, sigma);
\end{stancode}
%
has the same effect on the total log probability as
%
\begin{stancode}
for (n in 1:N)
  y[n] ~ normal(mu[n], sigma);
\end{stancode}




\chapter{Void Functions}

Stan does not technically support functions that do not return values.
It does support two types of statements that look like functions, one
for incrementing log probabilities and one for printing.
Documentation on these functions is included here for completeness.

Although it's not part of Stan's type language, in this chapter,
\code{void} will be used for the return type.

\section{Increment Log Probability}

There is a special function \code{increment\_log\_prob} takes a single
argument of any expression type \code{T}.
%
\begin{description}
  \fitem{void}{increment\_log\_prob}{T \farg{lp}}{Add \farg{lp} (or
    elements of \farg{lp} if \code{T} is a container type) to the
    total log probability accumulator returned by the log probability
    function defined by a Stan model.}
\end{description}
%
The expression \code{lp} can be of any expression type.  Specifically,
it can be an integer or real primitive, a vector, row vector, or
matrix, or an array of any type, including multidimensional arrays and
arrays of matrices, vectors, or row vectors.  Vector arguments are
included for convenience and have no speed advantage over adding
values in a loop.

The full behavior of the \code{increment\_log\_prob} statement and its
relation to sampling statements is described in
\refsection{increment-log-prob}.


\section{Print}

The \code{print} statement is unique among Stan's syntactic constructs
in two ways.  First, it is the only function-like construct that
allows a variable number of arguments.  Second, it is the only
function-like construct to accept string literals (e.g., \code{"hello
  world"}) as arguments.

Printing has no effect on the model's log probability function.  Its
sole purpose is the side effect (i.e., an effect not represented in a
return value) of arguments being printed to whatever the standard
output stream is connected to (e.g., the terminal in command-line Stan
or the R console in RStan).
%
\begin{description}
  \fitem{void}{print}{T1 \farg{x1},..., TN \farg{xN}}{Print the values
    denoted by the arguments \farg{x1} through \farg{xN} on the
    standard output stream.  There are no spaces between items in the
    print, but a line feed (LF; Unicode U+000A; \Cpp literal
    \code{'\textbackslash{n}'}) is inserted at the end of the printed
    line.  The types \code{T1} through \code{TN} can be any of Stan's
    built-in numerical types or double quoted strings of ASCII
    characters.}
\end{description}
%
The full behavior of the \code{print} statement with examples is
documented in \refsection{print-statements}.


\chapter{Integer-Valued Basic Functions}

\noindent
This chapter describes \Stan's built-in function that take various
types of arguments and return results of type integer.


\section{Integer-Valued Arithmetic Operators}\label{int-arithmetic.section}

\Stan's arithmetic is based on standard double-precision \Cpp integer and
floating-point arithmetic.  If the arguments to an arithmetic operator
are both integers, as in \code{2~+~2}, integer arithmetic is used.  If
one argument is an integer and the other a floating-point value, as in
\code{2.0~+~2} and \code{2~+~2.0}, then the integer is promoted to a floating
point value and floating-point arithmetic is used.

Integer arithmetic behaves slightly differently than floating point
arithmetic.  The first difference is how overflow is treated.  If the
sum or product of two integers overflows the maximum integer
representable, the result is an undesirable wraparound behavior at the
bit level.  If the integers were first promoted to real numbers, they
would not overflow a floating-point representation.  There are no
extra checks in \Stan to flag overflows, so it is up to the user to
make sure it does not occur.

Secondly, because the set of integers is not closed under division and
there is no special infinite value for integers, integer division
implicitly rounds the result.  If both arguments are positive, the
result is rounded down.  For example, \code{1~/~2} evaluates to 0 and
\code{5~/~3} evaluates to 1.  

If one of the integer arguments to division is negative, the latest
\Cpp specification (\Cpp{11}), requires rounding toward zero.  This
would have \code{-1~/~2} evaluate to 0 and \code{-7~/~2} evaluate to
3.  Before the \Cpp{11} specification, the behavior was platform
dependent, allowing rounding up or down.  All compilers recent enough
to be able to deal with Stan's templating should follow the \Cpp{11}
specification, but it may be worth testing if you are not sure and
plan to use integer division with negative values.

Unlike floating point division, where \code{1.0~/~0.0} produces the
special positive infinite value, integer division by zero, as in
\code{1~/~0}, has undefined behavior in the \Cpp standard.  For
example, the \clang compiler on Mac OS X returns 3764, whereas the
\gpp compiler throws an exception and aborts the program with a
warning.  As with overflow, it is up to the user to make sure integer
divide-by-zero does not occur.

\subsection{Binary Infix Operators}

Operators are described using the \Cpp syntax.  For instance, the
binary operator of addition, written \code{X + Y}, would have the
\Stan signature \code{int operator+(int,int)} indicating it takes
two real arguments and returns a real value.

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{int}{operator+}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}{
The sum of the addends \farg{x} and \farg{y}}
%
\fitem{int}{operator-}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}{
The difference between the minuend \farg{x} and subtrahend \farg{y}}
%
\fitem{int}{operator*}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}{

%
\fitem{int}{operator/}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}{
The integer quotient of the dividend \farg{x} and divisor \farg{y}}
%
\end{description}

\subsection{Unary Prefix Operators}

\begin{description}
\fitem{int}{operator-}{int \farg{x}}{
The negation of the subtrahend \farg{x}}

\fitem{int}{operator+}{int \farg{x}}{
This is a no-op.}
\end{description}

\section{Absolute Functions}

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{int}{abs}{int \farg{x}}{
  Returns the absolute value of \farg{x}. 
  \[\mbox{abs}(x) = |x|\]}

  Returns the integer step, or Heaviside, function of \farg{x}.
  \[
  \mbox{int\_step}(x) = 
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \mbox{if } x \leq 0 \\
    1 & \mbox{if } x > 0
  \end{cases}
  \]}
%
\end{description}
%

step functions applied to anything other than data.

  \fitem{int}{min}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}{
    Returns the minimum of \farg{x} and \farg{y}.

    \begin{cases}
      x & \mbox{if } x < y\\

      y & \mbox{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
\end{description}


\chapter{Real-Valued Basic Functions}

\noindent
This chapter describes built-in functions that take zero or more real
or integer arguments and return real values.  

\section{Mathematical Constants}\label{built-in-constants.section}

Constants are represented as functions with no arguments and must be
called as such.  For instance, the mathematical constant $\pi$ must be
written in a \Stan program as \code{pi()}.

%
\begin{description}
%
\fitem{real}{pi}{}{
  $\pi$, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter}
%
\fitem{real}{e}{}{

arithmetic on the current hardware platform}
%
\end{description}


\section{Log Probability Function}\label{get-lp.section}

The basic purpose of a Stan program is to compute a log probability
function and its derivatives.  The log probability function in a Stan
model outputs the log density on the unconstrained scale.  A log
probabilty accumulator starts at zero and is then incremented in
various ways by a Stan program.  The variables are first transformed
from unconstrained to constrained, and the log Jacobian determinant
added to the log probability accumulator.  Then the model block is
executed on the constrained parmeters, with each sampling statement
(\Verb|~|) and log probability increment statement
(\code{increment\_log\_prob}) adding to the accumulator.  At the end
of the model block execution, the value of the log probability
accumulator is the log probability value returned by the Stan program.

Stan provides a special built-in function \code{get\_lp} that takes no
arguments and returns the current value of the log probability
accumulator.  This function is primarily useful for debugging
purposes, where for instance, it may be used with a print statement to
display the log probability accumulator at various stages of execution
to see where it becomes ill defined.

\begin{description}
  \fitem{real}{get\_lp}{}{
    Returns the current value of the log probability
    accumulator.}
\end{description}

Like user-defined functions that end in \code{\_lp}, the log
probability get function may only be used in the transformed parameter
and model blocks, as well as in the bodies of functions with names
that also end in \code{\_lp}.


\section{Logical Functions}

Like C++, BUGS, and R, Stan uses 0 to encode false, and 1 to encode
true.  Stan supports the usual boolean comparison operations and
boolean operators.  These all have the same syntax and precedence as
in \Cpp; for the full list of operators and precedences, see
\reffigure{operator-precedence}.  


\subsection{Comparison Operators}

All comparison operators return boolean values, either 0 or 1.  Each
operator has two signatures, one for integer comparisons and one for
floating-point comparisons.  Comparing an integer and real value is
carried out by first promoting the integer value.
%
\begin{description}
  %
  \fitemnobody{int}{operator<}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}
  \fitem{int}{operator<}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is less than \farg{y} and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    (x \text{\textless} y) = 
    \text{operator\textless}(x,y) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $x < y$} \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
  \fitemnobody{int}{operator<=}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}
  \fitem{int}{operator<=}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is less than or equal \farg{y} and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    (x \text{\textless=} y)
    = \text{operator\textless=}(x,y)
    = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if $x \leq y$} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
  \fitemnobody{int}{operator>}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}
  \fitem{int}{operator>}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is greater than \farg{y} and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    (x \text{\textgreater} y) = 
    \text{operator\textgreater}(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $x > y$} \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
  \fitemnobody{int}{operator>=}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}
  \fitem{int}{operator>=}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is greater than or equal to \farg{y}
    and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    (x \text{\textgreater=} y) =
    \text{operator\textgreater=}(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $x \geq y$} \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
  \fitemnobody{int}{operator{==}}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}
  \fitem{int}{operator{==}}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is equal to \farg{y} and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    (x \text{==} y) = 
    \text{operator==}(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $x = y$} \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
  \fitemindexnobody{int}{operator!=}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}{operator"!"=}
  \fitemindex{int}{operator!=}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is not equal to \farg{y} and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    (x \text{!=} y) = 
    \text{operator!=}(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $x \neq y$} \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}{operator"!"=}
  %
\end{description}


\subsection{Boolean Operators}

Boolean operators return either 0 for false or 1 for true.  Inputs may
be any real or integer values, with non-zero values being treated as
true and zero values treated as false.  These operators have the usual
precedences, with negation (not) binding the most tightly, conjunction
the next and disjunction the weakest; all of the operators bind more
tightly than the comparisons.  Thus an expression such as
\code{!a~\&\&~b} is interpreted as \code{(!a)~\&\&~b}, and
\code{a~<~b~||~c~>=~d~\&\&~e~!=~f} as
\code{(a~<~b)~||~(((c~>=~d)~\&\&~(e~!=~f)))}.
%
\begin{description}
  %
  \fitemindexnobody{int}{operator!}{int \farg{x}}{operator"!}
  \fitemindex{int}{operator!}{real \farg{x}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is zero and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    (\text{!}x) =
    \text{operator!}(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{if $x \neq 0$} \\
      1 & \text{if $x = 0$}
    \end{cases}
    \]}{operator"!}
  %
  \fitemnobody{int}{operator{\&\&}}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}    
  \fitem{int}{operator{\&\&}}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is unequal to 0 and \farg{y} is unequal to 0.
    \[
    (x \text{\&\&} y) =
    \text{operator\&\&}(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $x \neq 0$} \text{ and } y \neq 0\\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
  \fitemindexnobody{int}{operator||}{int \farg{x}, int \farg{y}}{operator"|"|}
  \fitemindex{int}{operator||}{real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is unequal to 0 or \farg{y} is unequal to 0.
    \[
    (x \vert\vert y) = 
    % \textpipe from tipa package causes errors elsewhere
    % | does not render correctly, instead rendering as a horizonal bar
    % using math \vert seems the only option
    \text{operator||}(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $x \neq 0$} \textrm{ or } y \neq 0\\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
  }{operator"|"|}
  %
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Boolean Operator Short Circuiting}

Like in \Cpp, the boolean operators \Verb/&&/ and \Verb/||/ and are
implemented to short circuit directly to a return value after
evaluating the first argument if it is sufficient to resolve the
result.  In evaluating \code{a~||~b}, if \code{a} evaluates to a value
other than zero, the expression returns the value 1 without evaluating
the expression \code{b}.  Similarly, evaluating \code{a~\&\&~b} first
evaluates \code{a}, and if the result is zero, returns 0 without
evaluating \code{b}.


\subsection{Logical Functions}

The logical functions introduce conditional behavior functionally and
are primarily provided for compatibility with BUGS and JAGS.
%
\begin{description}
  %
  \fitem{real}{if\_else}{int \farg{cond}, real \farg{x}, real \farg{y}}{
    Returns \farg{x} if \farg{cond} is non-zero and \farg{y} otherwise.
    Stan's \code{if\_else} function does not short circuit---it
    always evaluates both arguments \farg{x} and \farg{y}.
    \[
    \mbox{if\_else}(cond,x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
      x & \mbox{if } cond \neq 0 \\
      y & \mbox{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
  \fitem{real}{step}{real \farg{x}}{
    Returns 1 if \farg{x} is positive and 0 otherwise.
    \[
    \mbox{step}(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \mbox{if } x > 0   \\
      0 & \mbox{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]}
  %
\end{description}
%
Both of these are step-like functions; see the warning in
\refsection{step-functions} applied to expressions dependent on
parameters. 

The step function is often used in BUGS to perform conditional
operations.  For instance, \code{step(a\,-\,b)} evaluates to 1 if
\code{a} is greater than {b} and evaluates to 0 otherwise.  In Stan,
the expression \code{step(a\,-\,b)} is more naturally coded directly
in terms of the comparison operator, \code{(a\,>\,b)}.  

The log probability function and gradient evaluations are more
efficient in Stan when implemented using conditional statements than
with mulitplications by step functions.  For example, if \code{y} is a
\code{real} variable, and \code{c}, \code{x1}, and \code{x2} are
scalar expressions (type \code{real} or \code{int}), then the
assignment statements
%
\begin{stancode}
y <- x1 * step(c) + x2 * (1 - step(c));
\end{stancode}
%
and
%
\begin{stancode}
y <- if_else(c > 0, x1, x2);
\end{stancode}
%
are more efficiently written with the conditional statement
%
\begin{stancode}
if (c > 0)
  y <- x1;
else
  y <- x2;
\end{stancode}
%
The reason the functional versions are slower is that they evaluate
all of their arguments; the step function approach is particularly
slow as it also introduces arithmetic operations.  The overhead will
be more noticeable if \code{c}, \code{x1} or \code{x2}
are parameters (including transformed parameters and local variables
that depend on parameters) or if \code{x1} and \code{x2} are
complicated expressions rather than constants or simple variables.  
%
\begin{description}
  %
  \fitem{int}{is\_inf}{real \farg{x}}{
    Returns \farg{1} if \farg{x} is infinite (positive or negative) and \farg{0} otherwise.
  }
  %
\end{description}
%
\begin{description}
  %
  \fitem{int}{is\_nan}{real \farg{x}}{
    Returns \farg{1} if \farg{x} is NaN and \farg{0} otherwise.
  }
  %
\end{description}
%
Care must be taken because both of these indicator functions are
step-like and thus can cause discontinuities in gradients when applied
to parameters; see \refsection{step-functions} for details.

\section{Real-Valued Arithmetic Operators}\label{real-valued-arithmetic-operators.section}

The arithmetic operators are presented using \Cpp notation.  For
instance \code{operator+(x,y)} refers to the binary addition operator
and \code{operator-(x)} to the unary negation operator.  In \Stan
programs, these are written using the usual infix and prefix notations
as \code{x~+~y} and \code{-x}, respectively.

\section{Step-like Functions}\label{step-functions.section}

{\it {\bf Warning:} These functions can seriously hinder sampling and
  optimization efficiency for gradient-based methods (e.g., NUTS, HMC,
  BFGS) if applied to parameters (including transformed parameters and
  local variables in the transformed parameters or model block).  The
  problem is that they break gradients due to discontinuities coupled with
  zero gradients elsewhere.  They do not hinder sampling when used in the
  data, transformed data, or generated quantities blocks.}

\end{description}


\subsection{Rounding Functions}

{\it Warning:}\ Rounding functions convert real values to integers.
Because the output is an integer, any gradient information resulting
from functions applied to the integer is not passed to the real value
it was derived from.  With MCMC sampling using HMC or NUTS, the
Metropolis/slice procedure will correct for any error due to poor
gradient calculations, but the result is likely to be reduced
acceptance probabilities and less efficient sampling.

The rounding functions cannot be used as indices to arrays because
they return real values.  Stan may introduce integer-valued versions
of these in the future, but as of now, there is no good workaround.

output values.  The boundary values for size 0 arrays are the unit
with respect to the combination operation (min, max, sum, or product).

\end{description}


\subsection{Moments}

Moments are only defined for arrays $x$ of size $N \geq 1$; it is an
error to call them with arrays of size $N = 0$.  The sample mean is
defined by
\[
\mbox{mean}(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N x_n.
\]
%
For $N \geq 2$, sample variance is defined for $N \geq 1$ by
\[
\mbox{variance}(x) 
= 
\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n=1}^N (x_n - \mbox{mean}(x))^2
\]
and sample standard deviation by 
\[
\mbox{sd}(x) = \sqrt{\, \mbox{variance}(x)},
\]
For convenience, when $N = 1$, $\mbox{variance(x)}$ and 
$\mbox{sd}(x)$ are defined to be 0.

% leaving gradients following for ref and in case we want
% to add them for all functions at some point

% For $N \geq 2$,
% \[
% \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \mbox{mean}(x)
% = \frac{1}{N}.
% \]
% For $N \geq 2$,
% \[
% \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \mbox{variance}(x)

%   \left( x_n - \mbox{mean}(x) \right).
% \]
% For $N \geq 2$,
% \[
% \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \mbox{sd}(x)
% = \frac{1}{(N - 1) \, \mbox{sd}(x)} 
%   \left( x_m - \mbox{mean}(x) \right)
% \]
% For $N \geq 2$, in the limit where $\mbox{sd}(x) = 0$, 
% % 
% \[

\end{description}

\section{Array Size and Dimension Function}

The size of an array or matrix can be obtained using the \code{dims()}
function.  The \code{dims()} function is defined to take an argument
consisting of any variable with up to 8 array dimensions (and up to 2
additional matrix dimensions) and returns an array of integers with
the dimensions.  For example, if two variables are declared as follows,
\begin{stancode}
real x[7,8,9];
matrix[8,9] y[7];
\end{stancode}
%
then calling \code{dims(x)} or \code{dims(y)} returns an integer 
array of size 3 containing the elements 7, 8, and 9 in that order. 

The \code{size()} function extracts the number of elements in an
array.  The function is overloaded to apply to arrays of integers,
reals, matrices, vectors, and row vectors.

\begin{description}
\fitem{int[]}{dims}{\farg{T} \farg{x}}{Returns an integer array
  containing the dimensions of \farg{x}; the type of the argument
  \farg{T} can be any Stan type with up to 8 array dimensions.}
%
\fitem{int}{num\_elements}{\farg{T}[] \farg{x}}{Returns the total
  number of elements in the array \farg{x} including all elements
  in contained arrays, vectors, and matrices.
  \farg{T} can be any array type.  For example, if \code{x} is of
  type \code{real[4,3]} then \code{num\_elements(x)} is 12, and if
  \code{y} is declared as \code{matrix[3,4]~y[5]}, then \code{size(y)}
  evaluates to 60.}
%
\fitem{int}{size}{\farg{T}[] \farg{x}}{Returns the number of elements
  in the array \farg{x}; the type of the array \farg{T} can be any
  type, but the size is just the size of the top level array, not the
  total number of elements contained.  For example, if \code{x} is of
  type \code{real[4,3]} then \code{size(x)} is 4.}
\end{description}


\section{Array Broadcasting}\label{array-broadcasting.section}

The following operations create arrays by repeating elements to fill
an array of a specified size.  These operations work for all input
types \farg{T}, including reals, integers, vectors, row vectors,
matrices, or arrays.
%
\begin{description}
\fitem{\farg{T}[]}{rep\_array}{\farg{T} \farg{x}, int \farg{n}}{Return
  the \farg{n} array with every entry assigned to \farg{x}.}
%
\fitem{\farg{T}[\,,\,]}{rep\_array}{\farg{T} \farg{x}, int \farg{m}, int
  \farg{n}}{Return the \farg{m} by \farg{n} array with every entry
  assigned to \farg{x}.}
%
\fitem{\farg{T}[\,,\,,\,]}{rep\_array}{\farg{T} \farg{x}, int
  \farg{k}, int \farg{m}, int
  \farg{n}}{Return the \farg{k} by \farg{m} by \farg{n} array with
  every entry assigned to \farg{x}.}
\end{description}
%
For example, \code{rep\_array(1.0,5)} produces a real array (type
\code{real[]}) of size 5 with all values set to 1.0.  On the other
hand, \code{rep\_array(1,5)} produces an integer array (type
\code{int[]}) of size 5 with all values set to 1.  This distinction is
important because it is not possible to assign an integer array to a
real array.  For example, the following example contrasts legal with
illegal array creation and assignment
%
\begin{stancode}
real y[5];
int x[5];

x <- rep_array(1,5);     // ok
y <- rep_array(1.0,5);   // ok

x <- rep_array(1.0,5);   // illegal 
y <- rep_array(1,5);     // illegal

x <- y;                  // illegal
y <- x;                  // illegal
\end{stancode}

If the value being repeated \code{v} is a vector (i.e., \code{T} is
\code{vector}), then \code{rep\_array(v,27)} is a size 27 array
consisting of 27 copies of the vector \code{v}.
%
\begin{stancode}
vector[5] v;
vector[5] a[3];
// ...
a <- rep_array(v,3);  // fill a with copies of v
a[2,4] <- 9.0;        // v[4], a[1,4], a[2,4] unchanged
\end{stancode}

If the type \farg{T} of \farg{x} is itself an array type, then the
result will be an array with one, two, or three added dimensions,
depending on which of the \code{rep\_array} functions is called.  For
instance, consider the following legal code snippet.
%
\begin{stancode}
real a[5,6];
real b[3,4,5,6];
// ...
b <- rep_array(a,3,4); //  make (3 x 4) copies of a
b[1,1,1,1] <- 27.9;    //  a[1,1] unchanged
\end{stancode}
%
After the assignment to \code{b}, the value for \code{b[j,k,m,n]} is
equal to \code{a[m,n]} where it is defined, for \code{j} in \code{1:3},
\code{k} in \code{1:4}, \code{m} in \code{1:5}, and \code{n} in
\code{1:6}.

\section{Sorting functions}\label{sorting-functions.section}

Sorting can be used to sort values or the indices of those values in
either ascending or descending order.  For example, if \code{v} is
declared as a real array of size 3, with values
\[
\mbox{\code{v}} = (1, -10.3, 20.987),
\]
then the various sort routines produce
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{\code{sort\_asc(v)}} & = &  (-10.3,1,20.987)
\\[4pt]
\mbox{\code{sort\_desc(v)}} & = &  (20.987,1,-10.3)
\\[4pt]
\mbox{\code{sort\_indices\_asc(v)}} & = &  (2,1,3)
\\[4pt]
\mbox{\code{sort\_indices\_desc(v)}} & = &  (3,1,2)
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Broadcast Functions}

The following broadcast functions allow vectors, row vectors and
matrices to be created by copying a single element into all of their
cells.  Matrices may also be created by stacking copies of row vectors
vertically or stacking copies of column vectors horizontally.

%

    size \farg{m} (column) vector consisting of copies of \farg{x}.}

    \farg{m} copies of the row vector \farg{rv} of size \farg{n}.}
%
\end{description}
%

Unlike the situation with array broadcasting (see \refsection{array-broadcasting}), where there is a
distinction between integer and real arguments, the following two
statements produce the same result for vector broadcasting;  row vector
and matrix broadcasting behave similarly.
%
\begin{stancode}
vector[3] x;
x <- rep_vector(1, 3);
x <- rep_vector(1.0, 3);  
\end{stancode}
%
There are no integer vector or matrix types, so integer values are
automatically promoted.

\section{Slice and Package Functions}

\subsection{Diagonal Matrices}

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{vector}{diagonal}{matrix \farg{x}}{The diagonal

%
\end{description}

The \code{row} function is special in that it may be used as an lvalue
in an assignment statement; for more information on assignment, see
\refsection{assignment-statement}.  The row function is also special
in that the indexing notation \code{x[m]} is just an alternative way
of writing \code{row(x,m)}.  The \code{col} function may {\it not}\, be
used as an lvalue, nor is there an indexing based shorthand for it.


\subsection{Block Operations}

\section{Special Matrix Functions}\label{softmax.section}

The softmax function maps $y \in \reals^K$ to the $K$-simplex by
\[
\mbox{softmax}(y)
 = \frac{\exp(y)}
        {\sum_{k=1}^K \exp(y_k)},
\]
%
where $\exp(y)$ is the componentwise exponentiation of $y$.
%
Softmax is usually calculated on the log scale, 
\[
\log \mbox{softmax}(y)
 \ = \ y - \log \sum_{k=1}^K \exp(y_k)
 \ = \ y - \mbox{log\_sum\_exp}(y).
\]
%
Stan provides the following functions for softmax and its log.

\fitem{row\_vector}{operator/}{row\_vector \farg{b}, matrix \farg{A}}{
The right division of \farg{b} by \farg{A}; equivalently
\code{\farg{b} * inverse(\farg{A})}}
%
\fitem{matrix}{operator/}{matrix \farg{B}, matrix \farg{A}}{

\end{description}

\subsection{Lower-Triangular Matrix-Division Functions}

There are four division functions which use lower triangular views of
a matrix.  The lower triangular view of a matrix $\mbox{tri}(A)$ is
used in the definitions and defined by
\[
\mbox{tri}(A)[m,n] = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
A[m,n] & \mbox{if } m \geq n, \mbox{ and}
\\[4pt]
0 & \mbox{otherwise}.
\end{array}
\right.
\]
When a lower triangular view of a matrix is used, the elements above
the diagonal are ignored.

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{row\_vector}{mdivide\_right\_tri\_low}{row\_vector \farg{B}, 
  matrix \farg{A}}{
The right division of \farg{B} by \code{tri(\farg{A})}, a lower triangular
view of \farg{A}; equivalently \code{\farg{B} * inverse(tri(\farg{A}))}}
%
%
\fitem{matrix}{mdivide\_right\_tri\_low}{matrix \farg{B}, matrix \farg{A}}{

view of \farg{A}; equivalently \code{\farg{B} * inverse(tri(\farg{A}))}}
%
\fitem{vector}{mdivide\_left\_tri\_low}{matrix \farg{A}, vector \farg{B}}

\code{tri(\farg{A})}, a lower triangular view of \farg{A}; equivalently

%
\end{description}


\subsection{Linear Algebra Functions}

\subsubsection{Trace}

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{real}{trace}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The trace of \farg{A}, or 0 if \farg{A} is empty;  \farg{A} is not
required to be diagonal}
%
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Determinants}

\begin{description}
\fitem{real}{determinant}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The determinant of \farg{A}}
%
\fitem{real}{log\_determinant}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The log of the absolute value of the determinant of \farg{A}}
%
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Inverses}

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{matrix}{inverse}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The inverse of \farg{A}}
%
\fitem{matrix}{inverse\_spd}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The inverse of \farg{A} where A is symmetric, positive definite.  This
version is faster and more arithmetically stable when the input is
symmetric and positive definite.}
%
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Eigendecomposition}

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{vector}{eigenvalues\_sym}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The vector of eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix \farg{A} 
in ascending order}
%
\fitem{matrix}{eigenvectors\_sym}{matrix \farg{A}}{ The matrix with
  the (column) eigenvectors of symmetric matrix \farg{A} in the same
  order as returned by the function \code{eigenvalues\_sym}}
%
\end{description}
%
Because multiplying an eigenvector by $-1$ results in an eigenvector,
eigenvectors returned by a decomposition are only identified up to a
sign change.  In order to compare the eigenvectors produced by Stan's
eigendecomposition to others, signs may need to be normalized in some
way, such as by fixing the sign of a component, or doing comparisons
allowing a multiplication by $-1$.

The condition number of a symmetric matrix is defined to be the ratio
of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue.  Large condition
numbers lead to difficulty in numerical algorithms such as computing
inverses, and thus known as ``ill conditioned.''  The ratio can even
be infinite in the case of singular matrices (i.e., those with
eigenvalues of 0).

%
% \fitem{vector}{eigenvalues\_self\_adjoint}{matrix \farg{A}}{The vector
%   of eigenvalues of the self-adjoint view of \farg{A} in descending
%   order.  The self-adjoint of matrix \farg{A} ignores the values in
%   \farg{A} above the diagonal and treats \farg{A}[m,n] =
%   \farg{A}[n,m].}
%
% \fitem{matrix}{eigenvectors\_self\_adjoint}{matrix \farg{A}}{ The
%   matrix of eigenvectors of the matrix of the self-adjoint view of
%   \farg{A}.  See \code{eigenvalues\_self\_adjoint} for information on
%   the self-adjoint view of a matrix.}
%

\subsubsection{QR Decomposition}

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{matrix}{qr\_Q}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The orthogonal matrix in the QR decomposition of \farg{A}}
%
\fitem{matrix}{qr\_R}{matrix \farg{A}}{
  The upper triangular matrix in the QR decomposition of \farg{A}}
%
\end{description}
%
Multiplying a column of an orthogonal matrix by $-1$ still results in 
an orthogonal matrix, and you can multiply the corresponding row of 
the upper triangular matrix by $-1$ without changing the product. Thus,
Stan adopts the normalization that the diagonal elements of the upper
triangular matrix are strictly positive and the columns of the 
orthogonal matrix are rescaled if necessary. The input matrix $A$ need
not be square but must have at least as many rows as it has columns.
Also, this QR decomposition algorithm does not utilize pivoting and 
thus is faster but may be numerically unstable.

\subsubsection{Cholesky Decomposition}

Every symmetric, positive-definite matrix (such as a correlation or
covariance matrix) has a Cholesky decomposition.  If $\Sigma$ is a
symmetric, positive-definite matrix, its Cholesky decomposition is the
lower-triangular vector $L$ such that
\[
\Sigma = L \, L^{\top}.
\]

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{matrix}{cholesky\_decompose}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The lower-triangular Cholesky factor of the symmetric
positive-definite matrix \farg{A}}
% 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Singular Value Decomposition}

Stan only provides functions for the singular values, not for the
singular vectors involved in a singular value decomposition (SVD).

\begin{description}
%
\fitem{vector}{singular\_values}{matrix \farg{A}}{
The singular values of \farg{A} in descending order}
%
\end{description}

\chapter{Mixed Operations}

These functions perform conversions between Stan containers matrix,
vector, row vector and arrays.

Whenever a conversion implies reduction of dimensionality (like
converting a matrix to a vector or a two dimensional array to a one
dimensional array), the conversion is proceed in row-major order when
the input is an array and in column-major order when the input is a
vector, a row vector or a matrix.

If the dimensionality is preserved (like when converting a matrix to a
two dimensional array), then the indexes are also fully preserved
which implies easy reversibility of the operation.
