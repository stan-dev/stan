@article{BelinDiffendalMackEtAl:1993,
	Abstract = {In the process of collecting Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) data to
	evaluate census coverage, it is inevitable that there will be some
	individuals whose enumeration status (outcome in the census-PES match)
	remains unresolved even after extensive field follow-up operations.
	Earlier work developed a logistic regression framework for imputing
	the probability that unresolved individuals were enumerated in the
	census, so that the probability of having been enumerated is allowed
	to depend on covariates. The covariates may include demographic characteristics,
	geographic information, and census codes that summarize information
	on the characteristics of the match (e.g., the before-follow-up match
	code assigned by clerks to describe the type of match between PES
	and census records). In the production of 1990 undercount estimates,
	the basic logistic regression model was expanded into a mixed hierarchical
	model to allow for the presence of group-specific effects, where
	groups are characterized by common before-follow-up match code. Parameter
	estimates for individual match-code groups thus "borrow strength"
	across groups by making use of observed relationships between group-specific
	parameter estimates in the various groups and the characteristics
	of the groups. This allows predictions to be made for groups for
	which there are few or no resolved cases to which to fit the model.
	The model was fitted by an approximate expectation-conditional-maximization
	(ECM) algorithm, using a large-sample approximation to the posterior
	distributions of group parameters. Uncertainty in estimation of model
	parameters was evaluated using a resampling procedure and became
	part of the evaluation of total error in PES estimates of population.
	Results from fitting the model in the 1990 Census and PES are described.},

	for survey responses should be constructed conditional on all variables
	that affect the probability of inclusion and nonresponse, which are
	also the variables used in survey weighting and clustering. However,
	such models can quickly become very complicated, with potentially
	thousands of poststratification cells. It is then a challenge to
	develop general families of multilevel probability models that yield
	reasonable Bayesian inferences. We discuss in the context of several
	ongoing public health and social surveys. This work is currently
	open-ended, and we conclude with thoughts on how research could proceed
	to solve these problems.},

	Abstract = {We present a method of analyzing a series of independent cross-sectional
	surveys in which some questions are not answered in some surveys
	and some respondents do not answer some of the questions posed. The
	method is also applicable to a single survey in which different questions
	are asked or different sampling methods are used in different strata
	or clusters. Our method involves multiply imputing the missing items
	and questions by adding to existing methods of imputation designed
	for single surveys a hierarchical regression model that allows covariates
	at the individual and survey levels. Information from survey weights
	is exploited by including in the analysis the variables on which
	the weights were based, and then reweighting individual responses
	(observed and imputed) to estimate population quantities. We also
	develop diagnostics for checking the fit of the imputation model
	based on comparing imputed data to nonimputed data. We illustrate
	with the example that motivated this project: a study of pre-election
	public opinion polls in which not all the questions of interest are
	asked in all the surveys, so that it is infeasible to impute within
	each survey separately.},

@article{GileHandcock:2010,
	Abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) employs a variant of a link-tracing
	network sampling strategy to collect data from hard-to-reach populations.
	By tracing the links in the underlying social network, the process
	exploits the social structure to expand the sample and reduce its
	dependence on the initial (convenience) sample.The current estimators
	of population averages make strong assumptions in order to treat
	the data as a probability sample. We evaluate three critical sensitivities
	of the estimators: (1) to bias induced by the initial sample, (2)
	to uncontrollable features of respondent behavior, and (3) to the
	without-replacement structure of sampling.Our analysis indicates:
	(1) that the convenience sample of seeds can induce bias, and the
	number of sample waves typically used in RDS is likely insufficient
	for the type of nodal mixing required to obtain the reputed asymptotic
	unbiasedness; (2) that preferential referral behavior by respondents
	leads to bias; (3) that when a substantial fraction of the target
	population is sampled the current estimators can have substantial
	bias.This paper sounds a cautionary note for the users of RDS. While
	current RDS methodology is powerful and clever, the favorable statistical
	properties claimed for the current estimates are shown to be heavily
	dependent on often unrealistic assumptions. We recommend ways to
	improve the methodology.},

@article{Heckathorn:1997,
	Abstract = {A population is "hidden" when no sampling frame exists and public
	acknowledgment of membership in the population is potentially threatening.
	Accessing such populations is difficult because standard probability
	sampling methods produce low response rates and responses that lack
	candor. Existing procedures for sampling these populations, including
	snowball and other chain-referral samples, the key-informant approach,
	and targeted sampling, introduce well-documented biases into their
	samples. This paper introduces a new variant of chain-referral sampling,
	respondent-driven sampling, that employs a dual system of structured
	incentives to overcome some of the deficiencies of such samples.
	A theoretic analysis, drawing on both Markov-chain theory and the
	theory of biased networks, shows that this procedure can reduce the
	biases generally associated with chain-referral methods. The analysis
	includes a proof showing that even though sampling begins with an
	arbitrarily chosen set of initial subjects, as do most chain-referral
	samples, the composition of the ultimate sample is wholly independent
	of those initial subjects. The analysis also includes a theoretic
	specification of the conditions under which the procedure yields
	unbiased samples. Empirical results, based on surveys of 277 active
	drug injectors in Connecticut, support these conclusions. Finally,
	the conclusion discusses how respondent-driven sampling can improve
	both network sampling and ethnographic 44investigation.},

	of population means using information about a related variable in
	the context of repeated sample surveys. The method is illustrated
	using poll results concerning presidential approval rating (our related
	variable is political party identification). We use poststratification
	to construct these improved estimates, but because we do not have
	population level information on the poststratifying variable, we
	construct a model for the manner in which the poststratifier develops
	over time. In this manner, we obtain more precise estimates without
	making possibly untenable assumptions about the dynamics of our variable
	of interest, the presidential approval rating.},

	Abstract = {Standard statistical methods often provide no way to make accurate
	estimates about the characteristics of hidden populations such as
	injection drug users, the homeless, and artists. In this paper, we
	further develop a sampling and estimation technique called respondent-driven
	sampling, which allows researchers to make asymptotically unbiased
	estimates about these hidden populations. The sample is selected
	with a snowball-type design that can be done more cheaply, quickly,
	and easily than other methods currently in use. Further, we can show
	that under certain specified (and quite general) conditions, our
	estimates for the percentage of the population with a specific trait
	are asymptotically unbiased. We further show that these estimates
	are asymptotically unbiased no matter how the seeds are selected.
	We conclude with a comparison of respondent-driven samples of jazz
	musicians in New York and San Francisco, with corresponding institutional
	samples of jazz musicians from these cities. The results show that
	some standard methods for studying hidden populations can produce
	misleading results.},

@article{BelinDiffendalMackEtAl:1993,
	Abstract = {In the process of collecting Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) data to
	evaluate census coverage, it is inevitable that there will be some
	individuals whose enumeration status (outcome in the census-PES match)
	remains unresolved even after extensive field follow-up operations.
	Earlier work developed a logistic regression framework for imputing
	the probability that unresolved individuals were enumerated in the
	census, so that the probability of having been enumerated is allowed
	to depend on covariates. The covariates may include demographic characteristics,
	geographic information, and census codes that summarize information
	on the characteristics of the match (e.g., the before-follow-up match
	code assigned by clerks to describe the type of match between PES
	and census records). In the production of 1990 undercount estimates,
	the basic logistic regression model was expanded into a mixed hierarchical
	model to allow for the presence of group-specific effects, where
	groups are characterized by common before-follow-up match code. Parameter
	estimates for individual match-code groups thus "borrow strength"
	across groups by making use of observed relationships between group-specific
	parameter estimates in the various groups and the characteristics
	of the groups. This allows predictions to be made for groups for
	which there are few or no resolved cases to which to fit the model.
	The model was fitted by an approximate expectation-conditional-maximization
	(ECM) algorithm, using a large-sample approximation to the posterior
	distributions of group parameters. Uncertainty in estimation of model
	parameters was evaluated using a resampling procedure and became
	part of the evaluation of total error in PES estimates of population.
	Results from fitting the model in the 1990 Census and PES are described.},

	for survey responses should be constructed conditional on all variables
	that affect the probability of inclusion and nonresponse, which are
	also the variables used in survey weighting and clustering. However,
	such models can quickly become very complicated, with potentially
	thousands of poststratification cells. It is then a challenge to
	develop general families of multilevel probability models that yield
	reasonable Bayesian inferences. We discuss in the context of several
	ongoing public health and social surveys. This work is currently
	open-ended, and we conclude with thoughts on how research could proceed
	to solve these problems.},

	Abstract = {We present a method of analyzing a series of independent cross-sectional
	surveys in which some questions are not answered in some surveys
	and some respondents do not answer some of the questions posed. The
	method is also applicable to a single survey in which different questions
	are asked or different sampling methods are used in different strata
	or clusters. Our method involves multiply imputing the missing items
	and questions by adding to existing methods of imputation designed
	for single surveys a hierarchical regression model that allows covariates
	at the individual and survey levels. Information from survey weights
	is exploited by including in the analysis the variables on which
	the weights were based, and then reweighting individual responses
	(observed and imputed) to estimate population quantities. We also
	develop diagnostics for checking the fit of the imputation model
	based on comparing imputed data to nonimputed data. We illustrate
	with the example that motivated this project: a study of pre-election
	public opinion polls in which not all the questions of interest are
	asked in all the surveys, so that it is infeasible to impute within
	each survey separately.},

	Abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) employs a variant of a link-tracing
	network sampling strategy to collect data from hard-to-reach populations.
	By tracing the links in the underlying social network, the process
	exploits the social structure to expand the sample and reduce its
	dependence on the initial (convenience) sample.The current estimators
	of population averages make strong assumptions in order to treat
	the data as a probability sample. We evaluate three critical sensitivities
	of the estimators: (1) to bias induced by the initial sample, (2)
	to uncontrollable features of respondent behavior, and (3) to the
	without-replacement structure of sampling.Our analysis indicates:
	(1) that the convenience sample of seeds can induce bias, and the
	number of sample waves typically used in RDS is likely insufficient
	for the type of nodal mixing required to obtain the reputed asymptotic
	unbiasedness; (2) that preferential referral behavior by respondents
	leads to bias; (3) that when a substantial fraction of the target
	population is sampled the current estimators can have substantial
	bias.This paper sounds a cautionary note for the users of RDS. While
	current RDS methodology is powerful and clever, the favorable statistical
	properties claimed for the current estimates are shown to be heavily
	dependent on often unrealistic assumptions. We recommend ways to
	improve the methodology.},

@article{Heckathorn:1997,
	Abstract = {A population is "hidden" when no sampling frame exists and public
	acknowledgment of membership in the population is potentially threatening.
	Accessing such populations is difficult because standard probability
	sampling methods produce low response rates and responses that lack
	candor. Existing procedures for sampling these populations, including
	snowball and other chain-referral samples, the key-informant approach,
	and targeted sampling, introduce well-documented biases into their
	samples. This paper introduces a new variant of chain-referral sampling,
	respondent-driven sampling, that employs a dual system of structured
	incentives to overcome some of the deficiencies of such samples.
	A theoretic analysis, drawing on both Markov-chain theory and the
	theory of biased networks, shows that this procedure can reduce the
	biases generally associated with chain-referral methods. The analysis
	includes a proof showing that even though sampling begins with an
	arbitrarily chosen set of initial subjects, as do most chain-referral
	samples, the composition of the ultimate sample is wholly independent
	of those initial subjects. The analysis also includes a theoretic
	specification of the conditions under which the procedure yields
	unbiased samples. Empirical results, based on surveys of 277 active
	drug injectors in Connecticut, support these conclusions. Finally,
	the conclusion discusses how respondent-driven sampling can improve
	both network sampling and ethnographic 44investigation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a general technique for the treatment of samples
	drawn without replacement from finite universes when unequal selection
	probabilities are used. Two sampling schemes are discussed in connection
	with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according
	to the information available in a supplementary variable. Admittedly,
	these two schemes have limited application. They should prove useful,
	however, for the first stage of sampling with multi-stage designs,
	since both permit unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without
	resorting to additional assumptions.},

	of population means using information about a related variable in
	the context of repeated sample surveys. The method is illustrated
	using poll results concerning presidential approval rating (our related
	variable is political party identification). We use poststratification
	to construct these improved estimates, but because we do not have
	population level information on the poststratifying variable, we
	construct a model for the manner in which the poststratifier develops
	over time. In this manner, we obtain more precise estimates without
	making possibly untenable assumptions about the dynamics of our variable
	of interest, the presidential approval rating.},

	Abstract = {Standard statistical methods often provide no way to make accurate
	estimates about the characteristics of hidden populations such as
	injection drug users, the homeless, and artists. In this paper, we
	further develop a sampling and estimation technique called respondent-driven
	sampling, which allows researchers to make asymptotically unbiased
	estimates about these hidden populations. The sample is selected
	with a snowball-type design that can be done more cheaply, quickly,
	and easily than other methods currently in use. Further, we can show
	that under certain specified (and quite general) conditions, our
	estimates for the percentage of the population with a specific trait
	are asymptotically unbiased. We further show that these estimates
	are asymptotically unbiased no matter how the seeds are selected.
	We conclude with a comparison of respondent-driven samples of jazz
	musicians in New York and San Francisco, with corresponding institutional
	samples of jazz musicians from these cities. The results show that
	some standard methods for studying hidden populations can produce
	misleading results.},
