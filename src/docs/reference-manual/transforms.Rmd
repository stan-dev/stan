# Constraint Transforms {#variable-transforms.chapter}

To avoid having to deal with constraints while simulating the
Hamiltonian dynamics during sampling, every (multivariate) parameter
in a Stan model is transformed to an unconstrained variable behind
the scenes by the model compiler.  The transform is based on the
constraints, if any, in the parameter's definition.  Scalars or the
scalar values in vectors, row vectors or matrices may be constrained
with lower and/or upper bounds.  Vectors may alternatively be
constrained to be ordered, positive ordered, or simplexes.  Matrices
may be constrained to be correlation matrices or covariance matrices.
This chapter provides a definition of the transforms used for each
type of variable.

Stan converts models to C++ classes which define probability
functions with support on all of $\mathbb{R}^K$, where $K$ is the number
of unconstrained parameters needed to define the constrained
parameters defined in the program.  The C++ classes also include
code to transform the parameters from unconstrained to constrained and
apply the appropriate Jacobians.


## Changes of Variables {#change-of-variables.section}

The support of a random variable $X$ with density $p_X(x)$ is that
subset of values for which it has non-zero density,

$$
\mathrm{supp}(X) = \{ x | p_X(x) > 0 \}.
$$

If $f$ is a total function defined on the support of $X$, then $Y =
f(X)$ is a new random variable.  This section shows how to compute the
probability density function of $Y$ for well-behaved transforms $f$.
The rest of the chapter details the transforms used by Stan.


### Univariate Changes of Variables {-}

Suppose $X$ is one dimensional and $f: \mathrm{supp}(X) \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ is a one-to-one, monotonic function with a differentiable
inverse $f^{-1}$.  Then the density of $Y$ is given by

$$
p_Y(y) = p_X(f^{-1}(y))
         \,
         \left| \, \frac{d}{dy} f^{-1}(y)\, \right|.
$$

The absolute derivative of the inverse transform measures how the
scale of the transformed variable changes with respect to the
underlying variable.


### Multivariate Changes of Variables {-}

The multivariate generalization of an absolute derivative is a
Jacobian, or more fully the absolute value of the determinant of the
Jacobian matrix of the transform.  The Jacobian matrix measures the change of
each output variable relative to every input variable and the absolute
determinant uses that to determine the differential change in volume
at a given point in the parameter space.

Suppose $X$ is a $K$-dimensional random variable with probability
density function $p_X(x)$.  A new random variable $Y = f(X)$ may be
defined by transforming $X$ with a suitably well-behaved function $f$.
It suffices for what follows to note that if $f$ is one-to-one
and its inverse $f^{-1}$ has a well-defined Jacobian, then the
density of $Y$ is

$$
p_Y(y) = p_X(f^{-1}(y)) \, \left| \, \det \, J_{f^{-1}}(y) \, \right|,
$$

where $\det{}$ is the matrix determinant operation and $J_{f^{-1}}(y)$
is the Jacobian matrix of $f^{-1}$ evaluated at $y$.  Taking $x =
f^{-1}(y)$, the Jacobian matrix is defined by

$$
J_{f^{-1}}(y) =
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}\displaystyle
\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial y_1}
& \cdots
& \displaystyle \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial y_{K}}
\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots
\\
\displaystyle\frac{\partial x_{K}}{\partial y_1}
& \cdots
& \displaystyle\frac{\partial x_{K}}{\partial y_{K}}
\end{array}
\right].
$$

If the Jacobian matrix is triangular, the determinant reduces to the
product of the diagonal entries,

$$
\det \, J_{f^{-1}}(y)
= \prod_{k=1}^K \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial y_k}.
$$

Triangular matrices naturally arise in situations where the variables
are ordered, for instance by dimension, and each variable's
transformed value depends on the previous variable's transformed
values.  Diagonal matrices, a simple form of triangular matrix, arise
if each transformed variable only depends on a single untransformed
variable.


## Lower Bounded Scalar {#lower-bound-transform.section}

Stan uses a logarithmic transform for lower and upper bounds.


### Lower Bound Transform {-}

If a variable $X$ is declared to have lower bound $a$, it is
transformed to an unbounded variable $Y$, where

$$
Y = \log(X - a).
$$


### Lower Bound Inverse Transform {-}

The inverse of the lower-bound transform maps an unbounded
variable $Y$ to a variable $X$ that is bounded below by $a$ by

$$
X = \exp(Y) + a.
$$


### Absolute Derivative of the Lower Bound Inverse Transform {-}

The absolute derivative of the inverse transform is

$$
\left| \,
\frac{d}{dy} \left( \exp(y) + a \right)
\, \right|
= \exp(y).
$$

Therefore, given the density $p_X$ of $X$, the density of $Y$ is

$$
p_Y(y)
= p_X\!\left( \exp(y) + a \right) \cdot \exp(y).
$$


## Upper Bounded Scalar

Stan uses a negated logarithmic transform for upper bounds.



### Upper Bound Transform {-}

If a variable $X$ is declared to have an upper bound $b$, it is
transformed to the unbounded variable $Y$ by

$$
Y = \log(b - X).
$$


### Upper Bound Inverse Transform {-}

The inverse of the upper bound transform converts the unbounded
variable $Y$ to the variable $X$ bounded above by $b$ through

$$
X = b - \exp(Y).
$$


### Absolute Derivative of the Upper Bound Inverse Transform {-}

The absolute derivative of the inverse of the upper bound transform is

$$
\left| \,
\frac{d}{dy} \left( b - \exp(y) \right)
\, \right|
= \exp(y).
$$

Therefore, the density of the unconstrained variable $Y$ is defined in
terms of the density of the variable $X$ with an upper bound of $b$ by

$$
p_Y(y)
 =   p_X \!\left( b - \exp(y) \right) \cdot \exp(y).
$$


## Lower and Upper Bounded Scalar {#logit-transform-jacobian.section}

For lower and upper-bounded variables, Stan uses a scaled and
translated log-odds transform.

### Log Odds and the Logistic Sigmoid {-}

The log-odds function is defined for $u \in (0,1)$ by

$$
\mathrm{logit}(u) = \log \frac{u}{1 - u}.
$$

The inverse of the log odds function is the logistic sigmoid, defined
for $v \in (-\infty,\infty)$ by

$$
\mathrm{logit}^{-1}(v) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-v)}.
$$

The derivative of the logistic sigmoid is

$$
\frac{d}{dy} \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y)
= \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y) \cdot \left( 1 - \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y) \right).
$$


### Lower and Upper Bounds Transform {-}

For variables constrained to be in the open interval $(a, b)$, Stan
uses a scaled and translated log-odds transform.  If variable $X$ is
declared to have lower bound $a$ and upper bound $b$, then it is
transformed to a new variable $Y$, where

$$
Y = \mathrm{logit} \left( \frac{X - a}{b - a} \right).
$$


### Lower and Upper Bounds Inverse Transform {-}

The inverse of this transform is

$$
X = a + (b - a) \cdot \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(Y).
$$


### Absolute Derivative of the Lower and Upper Bounds Inverse Transform {-}

The absolute derivative of the inverse transform is given by

$$
\left|
  \frac{d}{dy}
    \left(
      a + (b - a) \cdot \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y)
    \right)
  \right|
= (b - a)
    \cdot \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y)
    \cdot \left( 1 - \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y) \right).
$$

Therefore, the density of the transformed variable $Y$ is

$$
p_Y(y)
=
 p_X \! \left( a + (b - a) \cdot \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y) \right)
    \cdot (b - a)
    \cdot \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y)
    \cdot \left( 1 - \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y) \right).
$$

Despite the apparent complexity of this expression, most of the terms
are repeated and thus only need to be evaluated once.  Most
importantly, $\mathrm{logit}^{-1}(y)$ only needs to be evaluated once,
so there is only one call to $\exp(-y)$.


## Ordered Vector

For some modeling tasks, a vector-valued random variable $X$ is
required with support on ordered sequences.  One example is the set of
cut points in ordered logistic regression.

In constraint terms, an ordered $K$-vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^K$ satisfies

$$
x_k < x_{k+1}
$$

for $k \in \{ 1, \ldots, K-1 \}$.


### Ordered Transform {-}

Stan's transform follows the constraint directly.  It maps an
increasing vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$ to an unconstrained vector $y \in
\mathbb{R}^K$ by setting

$$
y_k
=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
x_1 & \mbox{if } k = 1, \mbox{ and}
\\
\log \left( x_{k} - x_{k-1} \right) & \mbox{if } 1 < k \leq K.
\end{array}
\right.
$$


### Ordered Inverse Transform {-}

The inverse transform for an unconstrained $y \in \mathbb{R}^K$ to an
ordered sequence $x \in \mathbb{R}^K$ is defined by the recursion

$$
x_k
=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
y_1 & \mbox{if } k = 1, \mbox{ and}
\\
x_{k-1} + \exp(y_k) & \mbox{if } 1 < k \leq K.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

$x_k$ can also be expressed iteratively as

$$
x_k = y_1 + \sum_{k'=2}^k \exp(y_{k'}).
$$


### Absolute Jacobian Determinant of the Ordered Inverse Transform {-}

The Jacobian of the inverse transform $f^{-1}$ is lower triangular,
with diagonal elements for $1 \leq k \leq K$ of

$$
J_{k,k} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{if } k = 1, \mbox{ and}
\\
\exp(y_k) & \mbox{if } 1 < k \leq K.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

Because $J$ is triangular, the absolute Jacobian determinant is

$$
\left| \, \det \, J \, \right|
\ = \
\left| \, \prod_{k=1}^K J_{k,k} \, \right|
\ = \
\prod_{k=2}^K \exp(y_k).
$$

Putting this all together, if $p_X$ is the density of $X$, then the
transformed variable $Y$ has density $p_Y$ given by

$$
p_Y(y)
= p_X(f^{-1}(y))
\
\prod_{k=2}^K \exp(y_k).
$$


## Unit Simplex {#simplex-transform.section}

Variables constrained to the unit simplex show up in multivariate
discrete models as both parameters (categorical and multinomial) and
as variates generated by their priors (Dirichlet and multivariate
logistic).

The unit $K$-simplex is the set of points $x \in \mathbb{R}^K$ such that
for $1 \leq k \leq K$,

$$
x_k > 0,
$$

and

$$
\sum_{k=1}^K x_k = 1.
$$

An alternative definition is to take the convex closure of the
vertices.  For instance, in 2-dimensions, the simplex vertices are the
extreme values $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$ and the unit 2-simplex is the line
connecting these two points; values such as $(0.3,0.7)$ and
$(0.99,0.01)$ lie on the line.  In 3-dimensions, the basis is
$(0,0,1)$, $(0,1,0)$ and $(1,0,0)$ and the unit 3-simplex is the
boundary and interior of the triangle with these vertices.  Points in
the 3-simplex include $(0.5,0.5,0)$, $(0.2,0.7,0.1)$ and all other
triplets of non-negative values summing to 1.

As these examples illustrate, the simplex always picks out a subspace
of $K-1$ dimensions from $\mathbb{R}^K$.  Therefore a point $x$ in the
$K$-simplex is fully determined by its first $K-1$ elements $x_1, x_2,
\ldots, x_{K-1}$, with

$$
x_K = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} x_k.
$$


### Unit Simplex Inverse Transform {-}

Stan's unit simplex inverse transform may be understood using the
following stick-breaking metaphor.^[For an alternative derivation of the same transform using hyperspherical coordinates, see [@Betancourt:2010].]

1.  Take a stick of unit length (i.e., length 1).
2.  Break a piece off and label it as $x_1$, and set it aside, keeping
what's left.
3.  Next, break a piece off what's left, label it $x_2$, and set it
aside, keeping what's left.
4.  Continue breaking off pieces of what's left, labeling them, and
setting them aside for pieces $x_3,\ldots,x_{K-1}$.
5.  Label what's left $x_K$.

The resulting vector $x = [x_1,\ldots,x_{K}]^{\top}$ is a unit
simplex because each piece has non-negative length and the sum of
the stick lengths is one by construction.

This full inverse mapping requires the breaks to be represented as the
fraction in $(0,1)$ of the original stick that is broken off.  These
break ratios are themselves derived from unconstrained values in
$(-\infty,\infty)$ using the inverse logit transform as described
above for unidimensional variables with lower and upper bounds.

More formally, an intermediate vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^{K-1}$, whose
coordinates $z_k$ represent the proportion of the stick broken off in
step $k$, is defined elementwise for $1 \leq k < K$ by

$$
z_k = \mathrm{logit}^{-1} \left( y_k
                             + \log \left( \frac{1}{K - k}
                                            \right)
                       \right).
$$

The logit term
$\log\left(\frac{1}{K-k}\right) (i.e., \mathrm{logit}\left(\frac{1}{K-k+1}\right)$) in
the above definition adjusts the transform so that a
zero vector $y$ is mapped to the simplex $x = (1/K,\ldots,1/K)$.  For instance, if
$y_1 = 0$, then $z_1 = 1/K$; if $y_2 = 0$, then $z_2 = 1/(K-1)$; and
if $y_{K-1} = 0$, then $z_{K-1} = 1/2$.

The break proportions $z$ are applied to determine the stick sizes and
resulting value of $x_k$ for $1 \leq k < K$ by

$$
x_k =
\left( 1 - \sum_{k'=1}^{k-1} x_{k'} \right) z_k.
$$

The summation term represents the length of the original stick left at
stage $k$.  This is multiplied by the break proportion $z_k$ to yield
$x_k$.  Only $K-1$ unconstrained parameters are required, with
the last dimension's value $x_K$ set to the length of the remaining
piece of the original stick,

$$
x_K = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} x_k.
$$


### Absolute Jacobian Determinant of the Unit-Simplex Inverse Transform {-}

The Jacobian $J$ of the inverse transform $f^{-1}$ is
lower-triangular, with diagonal entries

$$
J_{k,k}
=
\frac{\partial x_k}{\partial y_k}
=
\frac{\partial x_k}{\partial z_k} \,
\frac{\partial z_k}{\partial y_k},
$$

where

$$
\frac{\partial z_k}{\partial y_k}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial y_k}
   \mathrm{logit}^{-1} \left(
                       y_k + \log \left( \frac{1}{K-k}
                                          \right)
                    \right)
= z_k (1 - z_k),
$$

and

$$
\frac{\partial x_k}{\partial z_k}
=
\left(
  1 - \sum_{k' = 1}^{k-1} x_{k'}
   \right)
.
$$

This definition is recursive, defining $x_k$ in terms of
$x_{1},\ldots,x_{k-1}$.

Because the Jacobian $J$ of $f^{-1}$ is lower triangular and positive, its
absolute determinant reduces to

$$
\left| \, \det J \, \right|
\ = \
\prod_{k=1}^{K-1} J_{k,k}
\ = \
\prod_{k=1}^{K-1}
z_k
\,
(1 - z_k)
\
\left(
1 - \sum_{k'=1}^{k-1} x_{k'}
\right)
.
$$

Thus the transformed variable $Y = f(X)$ has a density given by

$$
p_Y(y)
= p_X(f^{-1}(y))
\,
\prod_{k=1}^{K-1}
z_k
\,
(1 - z_k)
\
\left(
1 - \sum_{k'=1}^{k-1} x_{k'}
\right)
.
$$

Even though it is expressed in terms of intermediate values $z_k$,
this expression still looks more complex than it is. The exponential
function need only be evaluated once for each unconstrained parameter
$y_k$; everything else is just basic arithmetic that can be computed
incrementally along with the transform.


### Unit Simplex Transform {-}

The transform $Y = f(X)$ can be derived by reversing the stages of the
inverse transform.  Working backwards, given the break proportions
$z$, $y$ is defined elementwise by

$$
y_k
= \mathrm{logit}(z_k)
- \mbox{log}\left(
   \frac{1}{K-k}
   \right)
.
$$

The break proportions $z_k$ are defined to be the ratio of $x_k$ to
the length of stick left after the first $k-1$ pieces have been broken
off,

$$
z_k
= \frac{x_k}
       {1 - \sum_{k' = 1}^{k-1} x_{k'}}
.
$$


## Unit Vector {#unit-vector.section}

An $n$-dimensional vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be a unit vector
if it has unit Euclidean length, so that

$$
\Vert x \Vert
\ = \ \sqrt{x^{\top}\,x}
\ = \ \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}
\ = \ 1\ .
$$


### Unit Vector Inverse Transform {-}

Stan divides an unconstrained vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ by its norm,
$\Vert y \Vert = \sqrt{y^\top y}$, to obtain a unit vector $x$,

$$
x = \frac{y}{\Vert y \Vert}.
$$

To generate a unit vector, Stan generates points at random in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ with independent unit normal distributions, which are then
standardized by dividing by their Euclidean length.
@Marsaglia:1972 showed this generates points uniformly at random
on $S^{n-1}$.  That is, if we draw $y_n \sim \mathsf{Normal}(0, 1)$
for $n \in 1{:}n$, then $x = \frac{y}{\Vert y \Vert}$ has a uniform
distribution over $S^{n-1}$.  This allows us to use an $n$-dimensional
basis for $S^{n-1}$ that preserves local neighborhoods in that points
that are close to each other in $\mathbb{R}^n$ map to points near each
other in $S^{n-1}$.  The mapping is not perfectly distance preserving,
because there are points arbitrarily far away from each other in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ that map to identical points in $S^{n-1}$.


#### Warning: undefined at zero! {-}

The above mapping from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $S^n$ is not defined at zero.
While this point outcome has measure zero during sampling, and may
thus be ignored, it is the default initialization point and thus unit
vector parameters cannot be initialized at zero.  A simple workaround
is to initialize from a very small interval around zero, which is an
option built into all of the Stan interfaces.


### Absolute Jacobian Determinant of the Unit Vector Inverse Transform {-}

The Jacobian matrix relating the input vector $y$ to the output vector
$x$ is singular because $x^\top x = 1$ for any non-zero input vector
$y$. Thus, there technically is no unique transformation from $x$ to
$y$. To circumvent this issue, let $r = \sqrt{y^\top y}$ so that $y = r
x$. The transformation from $\left(r, x_{-n}\right)$ to $y$ is
well-defined but $r$ is arbitrary, so we set $r = 1$. In this case,
the determinant of the Jacobian is proportional to $-\frac{1}{2} y^\top y$,
which is the kernel of a standard multivariate normal distribution
with $n$ independent dimensions.


## Correlation Matrices {#correlation-matrix-transform.section}

A $K \times K$ correlation matrix $x$ must be is a symmetric, so that

$$
x_{k,k'} = x_{k',k}
$$

for all $k,k' \in \{ 1, \ldots, K \}$, it must have a unit diagonal,
so that

$$
x_{k,k} = 1
$$

for all $k \in \{ 1, \ldots, K \}$, and it must be positive
definite, so that for every non-zero $K$-vector $a$,

$$
a^{\top} x a > 0.
$$

The number of free parameters required to specify a $K \times K$
correlation matrix is $\binom{K}{2}$.

There is more than one way to map from $\binom{K}{2}$ unconstrained
parameters to a $K \times K$ correlation matrix.  Stan implements the
Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe (LKJ) transform
@LewandowskiKurowickaJoe:2009.


### Correlation Matrix Inverse Transform {-}

It is easiest to specify the inverse, going from its $\binom{K}{2}$
parameter basis to a correlation matrix.  The basis will actually be
broken down into two steps.  To start, suppose $y$ is a vector
containing $\binom{K}{2}$ unconstrained values.  These are first
transformed via the bijective function $\tanh : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow
(-1, 1)$

$$
\tanh x = \frac{\exp(2x) - 1}{\exp(2x) + 1}.
$$

Then, define a $K \times K$ matrix $z$, the upper triangular values of
which are filled by row with the transformed values.  For example, in
the $4 \times 4$ case, there are $\binom{4}{2}$ values arranged as

$$
z
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & \tanh y_1 & \tanh y_2 & \tanh y_4
\\
0 & 0 & \tanh y_3 & \tanh y_5
\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \tanh y_6
\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
.
$$

Lewandowski, Kurowicka and Joe (LKJ) show how to bijectively map the
array $z$ to a correlation matrix $x$.  The entry $z_{i,j}$ for $i <
j$ is interpreted as the canonical partial correlation (CPC) between
$i$ and $j$, which is the correlation between $i$'s residuals and
$j$'s residuals when both $i$ and $j$ are regressed on all variables
$i'$ such that $i'< i$.  In the case of $i=1$, there are no earlier
variables, so $z_{1,j}$ is just the Pearson correlation between $i$
and $j$.

In Stan, the LKJ transform is reformulated in terms of a Cholesky factor $w$
of the final correlation matrix, defined for $1 \leq i,j \leq K$ by

$$
w_{i,j} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \mbox{if } i > j,
\\
1 & \mbox{if } 1 = i = j,
\\
\prod_{i'=1}^{i - 1} \left( 1 - z_{i'\!,\,j}^2 \right)^{1/2}
& \mbox{if } 1 < i = j,
\\
z_{i,j} & \mbox{if } 1 = i < j, \mbox{ and}
\\\
z_{i,j} \, \prod_{i'=1}^{i-1} \left( 1 - z_{i'\!,\,j}^2 \right)^{1/2}
& \mbox{ if } 1 < i < j.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

This does not require as much computation per matrix entry as it may appear;
calculating the rows in terms of earlier rows yields the more
manageable expression

$$
w_{i,j} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \mbox{if } i > j,
\\
1 & \mbox{if } 1 = i = j,
\\
z_{i,j} & \mbox{if } 1 = i < j, \mbox{ and}
\\
z_{i,j} \ w_{i-1,j} \left( 1 - z_{i-1,j}^2 \right)^{1/2}
& \mbox{ if } 1 < i \leq j.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

Given the upper-triangular Cholesky factor $w$, the final correlation
matrix is

$$
x = w^{\top} w.
$$

@LewandowskiKurowickaJoe:2009 show that the determinant of the correlation
matrix can be defined in terms of the canonical partial correlations
as

$$
\mbox{det} \, x = \prod_{i=1}^{K-1} \ \prod_{j=i+1}^K \ (1 - z_{i,j}^2)
 = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq K} (1 - z_{i,j}^2),
$$


### Absolute Jacobian Determinant of the Correlation Matrix Inverse Transform {-}

From the inverse of equation 11 in [@LewandowskiKurowickaJoe:2009],
the absolute Jacobian determinant is

$$
\sqrt{\prod_{i=1}^{K-1}\prod_{j=i+1}^K \left(1-z_{i,j}^2\right)^{K-i-1}} \
\times \prod_{i=1}^{K-1}\prod_{j=i+1}^K
\frac{\partial z_{i,j}}{\partial y_{i,j}}
$$


### Correlation Matrix Transform {-}

The correlation transform is defined by reversing the steps of the
inverse transform defined in the previous section.

Starting with a correlation matrix $x$, the first step is to find the
unique upper triangular $w$ such that $x = w w^{\top}$.  Because $x$
is positive definite, this can be done by applying the Cholesky
decomposition,

$$
w = \mbox{chol}(x).
$$

The next step from the Cholesky factor $w$ back to the array $z$ of
canonical partial correlations (CPCs) is simplified by the ordering of the elements in the
definition of $w$, which when inverted yields

$$
z_{i,j} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \mbox{if } i \leq j,
\\
w_{i,j} & \mbox{if } 1 = i < j, \mbox{ and}
\\
{w_{i,j}}
\
\prod_{i'=1}^{i-1} \left( 1 - z_{i'\!,j}^2 \right)^{-1/2}
& \mbox{if } 1 < i < j.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

The final stage of the transform reverses the hyperbolic tangent
transform, which is defined by

$$
\tanh^{-1} v = \frac{1}{2} \log \left( \frac{1 + v}{1 - v} \right).
$$

The inverse hyperbolic tangent function, $\tanh^{-1}$, is also called
the Fisher transformation.


## Covariance Matrices

A $K \times K$ matrix is a covariance matrix if it is symmetric and
positive definite (see the previous section for definitions).  It
requires $K + \binom{K}{2}$ free parameters to specify a $K \times K$
covariance matrix.


### Covariance Matrix Transform {-}

Stan's covariance transform is based on a Cholesky decomposition
composed with a log transform of the positive-constrained diagonal
elements.^[An alternative to the transform in this section, which can be coded directly in Stan, is to parameterize a covariance matrix as a scaled correlation matrix.  An arbitrary $K \times K$ covariance matrix $\Sigma$ can be expressed in terms of a $K$-vector $\sigma$ and correlation matrix $\Omega$ as $$\Sigma = \mbox{diag}(\sigma) \times \Omega \times \mbox{diag}(\sigma),$$ so that each entry is just a deviation-scaled correlation, $$\Sigma_{m,n} = \sigma_m \times \sigma_n \times \Omega_{m,n}.$$]

If $x$ is a covariance matrix (i.e., a symmetric, positive definite
matrix), then there is a unique lower-triangular matrix $z =
\mathrm{chol}(x)$ with positive diagonal entries, called a Cholesky
factor, such that

$$
x = z \, z^{\top}.
$$

The off-diagonal entries of the Cholesky factor $z$ are unconstrained,
but the diagonal entries $z_{k,k}$ must be positive for $1 \leq k
\leq K$.

To complete the transform, the diagonal is log-transformed to produce
a fully unconstrained lower-triangular matrix $y$ defined by

$$
y_{m,n} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \mbox{if } m < n,
\\
\log z_{m,m} & \mbox{if } m = n, \mbox{ and}
\\
z_{m,n} & \mbox{if } m > n.
\end{array}
\right.
$$


### Covariance Matrix Inverse Transform {-}

The inverse transform reverses the two steps of the transform.
Given an unconstrained lower-triangular $K \times K$ matrix $y$, the
first step is to recover the intermediate matrix $z$ by reversing the
log transform,

$$
z_{m,n} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \mbox{if } m < n,
\\
\exp(y_{m,m}) & \mbox{if } m = n, \mbox{ and}
\\
y_{m,n} & \mbox{if } m > n.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

The covariance matrix $x$ is recovered from its Cholesky factor $z$ by
taking

$$
x = z \, z^{\top}.
$$


### Absolute Jacobian Determinant of the Covariance Matrix Inverse Transform {-}

The Jacobian is the product of the Jacobians of the exponential
transform from the unconstrained lower-triangular matrix $y$ to matrix
$z$ with positive diagonals and the product transform from the
Cholesky factor $z$ to $x$.

The transform from unconstrained $y$ to Cholesky factor $z$ has a
diagonal Jacobian matrix, the absolute determinant of which is thus

$$
\prod_{k=1}^K  \frac{\partial}{\partial_{y_{k,k}}} \, \exp(y_{k,k})
\ = \
\prod_{k=1}^K \exp(y_{k,k})
\ = \
\prod_{k=1}^K z_{k,k}.
$$

The Jacobian matrix of the second transform from the Cholesky factor $z$ to
the covariance matrix $x$ is also triangular, with diagonal entries
corresponding to pairs $(m,n)$ with $m \geq n$, defined by

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial z_{m,n}}
\left( z \, z^{\top} \right)_{m,n}
\ = \
\frac{\partial}{\partial z_{m,n}}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^K z_{m,k} \, z_{n,k} \right)
\ = \
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
2 \, z_{n,n} & \mbox{if } m = n \mbox{ and }
\\
z_{n,n} & \mbox{if } m > n.
\end{array}
\right.
$$

The absolute Jacobian determinant of the second transform is thus

$$
2^{K} \ \prod_{m = 1}^{K} \ \prod_{n=1}^{m} z_{n,n}
\ = \
\prod_{n=1}^K \ \prod_{m=n}^K z_{n,n}
\ = \
2^{K} \ \prod_{k=1}^K z_{k,k}^{K - k + 1}.
$$

Finally, the full absolute Jacobian determinant of the inverse
of the covariance matrix transform from the unconstrained lower-triangular
$y$ to a symmetric, positive definite matrix $x$ is the product of the
Jacobian determinants of the exponentiation and product transforms,

$$
\left( \prod_{k=1}^K z_{k,k} \right)
\left(
2^{K} \ \prod_{k=1}^K z_{k,k}^{K - k + 1}
\right)
\ = \
2^K
\, \prod_{k=1}^K z_{k,k}^{K-k+2}.
$$

Let $f^{-1}$ be the inverse transform from a $K + \binom{K}{2}$-vector
$y$ to the $K \times K$ covariance matrix $x$.  A density function
$p_X(x)$ defined on $K \times K$ covariance matrices is transformed to
the density $p_Y(y)$ over $K + \binom{K}{2}$ vectors $y$ by

$$
p_Y(y) = p_X(f^{-1}(y)) \ 2^K \ \prod_{k=1}^K z_{k,k}^{K-k+2}.
$$


## Cholesky Factors of Covariance Matrices

An $M \times M$ covariance matrix $\Sigma$ can be Cholesky factored to
a lower triangular matrix $L$ such that $L\,L^{\top} = \Sigma$.  If
$\Sigma$ is positive definite, then $L$ will be $M \times M$.  If
$\Sigma$ is only positive semi-definite, then $L$ will be $M \times N$,
with $N < M$.

A matrix is a Cholesky factor for a covariance matrix if and only if
it is lower triangular, the diagonal entries are positive, and $M \geq
N$.  A matrix satisfying these conditions ensures that $L \,
L^{\top}$ is positive semi-definite if $M > N$ and positive definite
if $M = N$.

A Cholesky factor of a covariance matrix requires $N + \binom{N}{2} +
(M - N)N$ unconstrained parameters.


### Cholesky Factor of Covariance Matrix Transform {-}

Stan's Cholesky factor transform only requires the first step of the
covariance matrix transform, namely log transforming the positive
diagonal elements.  Suppose $x$ is an $M \times N$ Cholesky factor.
The above-diagonal entries are zero, the diagonal entries are
positive, and the below-diagonal entries are unconstrained.  The
transform required is thus

$$
y_{m,n} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \mbox{if } m < n,
\\
\log x_{m,m} & \mbox{if } m = n, \mbox{ and}
\\
x_{m,n} & \mbox{if } m > n.
\end{array}
\right.
$$


### Cholesky Factor of Covariance Matrix Inverse Transform {-}

The inverse transform need only invert the logarithm with an
exponentiation.  If $y$ is the unconstrained matrix representation,
then the elements of the constrained matrix $x$ is defined by

$$
x_{m,n} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \mbox{if } m < n,
\\
\exp(y_{m,m}) & \mbox{if } m = n, \mbox{ and}
\\
y_{m,n} & \mbox{if } m > n.
\end{array}
\right.
$$


### Absolute Jacobian Determinant of Cholesky Factor Inverse Transform {-}

The transform has a diagonal Jacobian matrix, the absolute determinant
of which is

$$
\prod_{n=1}^N  \frac{\partial}{\partial_{y_{n,n}}} \, \exp(y_{n,n})
\ = \
\prod_{n=1}^N \exp(y_{n,n})
\ = \
\prod_{n=1}^N x_{n,n}.
$$

Let $x = f^{-1}(y)$ be the inverse transform from a $N + \binom{N}{2}
+ (M - N)N$ vector to an $M \times N$ Cholesky factor for a covariance
matrix $x$ defined in the previous section.  A density function
$p_X(x)$ defined on $M \times N$ Cholesky factors of covariance
matrices is transformed to the density $p_Y(y)$ over $N + \binom{N}{2}
+ (M - N)N$ vectors $y$ by

$$
p_Y(y) = p_X(f^{-1}(y)) \prod_{N=1}^N x_{n,n}.
$$


## Cholesky Factors of Correlation Matrices

A $K \times K$ correlation matrix $\Omega$ is positive definite and
has a unit diagonal.  Because it is positive definite, it can be
Cholesky factored to a $K \times K$ lower-triangular matrix $L$ with
positive diagonal elements such that $\Omega = L\,L^{\top}$.  Because
the correlation matrix has a unit diagonal,

$$
\Omega_{k,k} = L_k\,L_k^{\top} = 1,
$$

each row vector $L_k$ of the Cholesky factor is of unit length.  The
length and positivity constraint allow the diagonal elements of $L$ to
be calculated from the off-diagonal elements, so that a Cholesky
factor for a $K \times K$ correlation matrix requires only
$\binom{K}{2}$ unconstrained parameters.


### Cholesky Factor of Correlation Matrix Inverse Transform {-}

It is easiest to start with the inverse transform from the $\binom{K}{2}$ unconstrained parameters $y$ to the $K \times K$ lower-triangular Cholesky factor $x$.  The inverse transform is based on the hyperbolic tangent function, $\tanh$, which satisfies $\tanh(x) \in (-1,1)$.  Here it will function like an inverse logit with a sign to pick out the direction of an underlying canonical partial correlation; see the [section on correlation matrix transforms](#correlation-matrix-transform.section) for more information on the relation between canonical partial correlations and the Cholesky factors of correlation matrices.

Suppose $y$ is a vector of $\binom{K}{2}$ unconstrained values.  Let
$z$ be a lower-triangular matrix with zero diagonal and below
diagonal entries filled by row.  For example, in the $3 \times 3$
case,

$$
z =
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0
\\
\tanh y_1 & 0 & 0
\\
\tanh y_2 & \tanh y_3 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
$$

The matrix $z$, with entries in the range $(-1, 1)$, is then
transformed to the Cholesky factor $x$, by taking^[For convenience, a summation with no terms, such as $\sum_{j' < 1} x_{i,j'}$, is defined to be 0.  This implies  $x_{1,1} = 1$ and that $x_{i,1} = z_{i,1}$ for $i > 1$.]

$$
x_{i,j}
=
\left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
0 & \mbox{ if } i < j & \mbox{ [above diagonal]}
\\
\sqrt{1 - \sum_{j' < j} x_{i,j'}^2}
  & \mbox{ if } i = j & \mbox{ [on diagonal]}
\\
z_{i,j} \ \sqrt{1 - \sum_{j' < j} x_{i,j'}^2}
  & \mbox{ if } i > j & \mbox{ [below diagonal]}
\end{array}
\right.
$$

In the $3 \times 3$ case, this yields

$$
x =
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0
\\
z_{2,1} & \sqrt{1 - x_{2,1}^2} & 0
\\
z_{3,1} & z_{3,2} \sqrt{1 - x_{3,1}^2}
        & \sqrt{1 - (x_{3,1}^2 + x_{3,2}^2)}
\end{array}
\right],
$$

where the $z_{i,j} \in (-1,1)$ are the $\tanh$-transformed $y$.

The approach is a signed stick-breaking process on the quadratic
(Euclidean length) scale.  Starting from length 1 at $j=1$, each
below-diagonal entry $x_{i,j}$ is determined by the (signed) fraction
$z_{i,j}$ of the remaining length for the row that it consumes. The
diagonal entries $x_{i,i}$ get any leftover length from earlier
entries in their row.  The above-diagonal entries are zero.


### Cholesky Factor of Correlation Matrix Transform {-}

Suppose $x$ is a $K \times K$ Cholesky factor for some correlation
matrix.  The first step of the transform reconstructs the intermediate
values $z$ from $x$,

$$
z_{i,j} = \frac{x_{i,j}}{\sqrt{1 - \sum_{j' < j}x_{i,j'}^2}}.
$$

The mapping from the resulting $z$ to $y$ inverts $\tanh$,

$$
y
\ = \
\tanh^{-1} z
\ = \
\frac{1}{2} \left( \log (1 + z) - \log (1 - z) \right).
$$


### Absolute Jacobian Determinant of Inverse Transform {-}

The Jacobian of the full transform is the product of the Jacobians of
its component transforms.

First, for the inverse transform $z = \tanh y$, the derivative is

$$
\frac{d}{dy} \tanh y = \frac{1}{(\cosh y)^2}.
$$

Second, for the inverse transform of $z$ to $x$, the resulting
Jacobian matrix $J$ is of dimension $\binom{K}{2} \times
\binom{K}{2}$, with indexes $(i,j)$ for $(i > j)$.  The Jacobian
matrix is lower triangular, so that its determinant is the product of
its diagonal entries, of which there is one for each $(i,j)$ pair,

$$
\left| \, \mbox{det} \, J \, \right|
  \ = \ \prod_{i > j} \left| \frac{d}{dz_{i,j}} x_{i,j} \right|,
$$

where

$$
\frac{d}{dz_{i,j}} x_{i,j}
= \sqrt{1 - \sum_{j' < j} x^2_{i,j'}}.
$$

So the combined density for unconstrained $y$ is

$$
p_Y(y)
= p_X(f^{-1}(y))
  \ \
  \prod_{n < \binom{K}{2}} \frac{1}{(\cosh y)^2}
  \ \
  \prod_{i > j} \left( 1 - \sum_{j' < j} x_{i,j'}^2
  \right)^{1/2},
$$

where $x = f^{-1}(y)$ is used for notational convenience.  The log
Jacobian determinant of the complete inverse transform $x = f^{-1}(y)$
is given by

$$
\log \left| \, \det J \, \right|
=
-2 \sum_{n \leq \binom{K}{2}}
\log \cosh y
\
+
\
\frac{1}{2} \
\sum_{i > j}
\log \left( 1 - \sum_{j' < j} x_{i,j'}^2 \right)
.
$$
