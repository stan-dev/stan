Stan supports C++-style line-based and bracketed comments.  Comments
may be used anywhere whitespace is allowed in a Stan program.

## Line-Based Comments 

Any characters on a line following two forward slashes (`//`) is
ignored along with the slashes.  These may be used, for example, to
document variables,

```stan
data {
  int<lower=0> N;  // number of observations
  real y[N];  // observations
}
```

## Bracketed Comments 

For bracketed comments, any text between a forward-slash and asterisk
pair (`/*`) and an asterisk and forward-slash pair (`*/`) is
ignored.
