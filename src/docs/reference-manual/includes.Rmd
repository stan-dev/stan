# Includes {#includes.section}

Stan allows one file to be included within another file with the
following syntax.  For example, suppose the file
`my-std-normal.stan` defines the standard normal log probability
density function (up to an additive constant).

```stan
functions {
  real my_std_normal_lpdf(vector y) {
    return -0.5 * y' * y;
  }
}
```

Suppose we also have a file containing a Stan program with an include
statement.

```stan
#include my-std-normal.stan
parameters {
  real y;
}
model {
  y ~ my_std_normal();
}
```

This Stan program behaves as if the contents of the file
`my-std-normal.stan` replace the line with the `#include`
statement, behaving as if a single Stan program were provided.

```stan
functions {
  real my_std_normal_lpdf(vector y) {
    return -0.5 * y' * y;
  }
}
parameters {
  real y;
}
model {
  y ~ my_std_normal();
}
```


There are no restrictions on where include statements may be placed
within a file or what the contents are of the replaced file.  No
additional whitespace is included beyond what is in the included file.

## Recursive Includes 

Recursive includes will be ignored.  For example, suppose
`a.stan` contains

```stan
#include b.stan
```

and `b.stan` contains

```stan
#include a.stan
```

The result of processing this file will be empty, because
`a.stan` will include `b.stan`, from which the include of
`a.stan` is ignored and a warning printed.

## Include Paths 

The Stan interfaces provide a mechanism for specifying a sequence of
system paths in which to search for include files.  The file included
is the first one that is found in the sequence.
