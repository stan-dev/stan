STAN C++ RELEASE NOTES
======================================================================

Note: these are the release notes for the stan-dev/stan repository.
Further changes may arise at the interface level (stan-dev/{rstan,
pystan, cmdstan}) and math library level (stan-dev/math).

- cleaned up includes of Eigen

v.2.24.0 (28 July 2020)
======================================================================

- `std::chrono` is now used for all timing purposes
- fixed a bug with generated quantities for vectors of length 1
- added `recover_memory` for normal exit of `log_prob_grad`

  -- indexing fixed for arrays of matrix/vector/row_vector
  -- fixed sd() and variance() to return 0.0 for sequences of size 1
  -- fixed void return type in auto_covariance
  -- patch truncation to return -inf for variates out of range
  -- upgraded BUGS ring model to use constraints plus tan2()
New Features:
  -- print statements
  -- multiply_lower_tri_self_transpose function
  -- vectorized several probability functions (see the manual)
Manual Additions:
  -- programming guide: IRT models
