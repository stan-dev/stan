<h1>Stan: Contribute Code &amp; Models</h1>
<hr />

<p>Stan is open source because we want your feedback to help make Stan's
code and documentation better.</p>

<h2>Contribute Code Patches</h2>

<p>If you'd like to contribute a bug patch, please submit a Git patch
or Git pull request either on the user's or developer's <a
 href="mailing-lists.html">mailing list</a> or through the <a
 href="bugs-features.html">issue tracker</a>.  After testing and
merging, contributions will be distributed under Stan's new BSD license.
</p>

<h2>Contribute Models and Data</h2>

<p>We're still discussing how to support user-contributed models.  The
issues to sort out are</p>
<ul>
  <li>how to vet the models to make sure they work,</li>
  <li>how to handle intellectual property and licensing, and</li>
  <li>how to store and distribute them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have suggestions, let us know on the
<a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>
