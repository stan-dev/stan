C++ API
======================================================================
[items go here first, then to RStan/cmd]

* rewrite elt_multiply() in matrix.hpp.
  -- should be able to write one templated function to allow for
     all our uses of elt_multiply.
  -- needs tests.
  -- once it's implemented, go into inv_wishart_log and revert code

* consider alternative transforms
  -- ordered as logit(cumulative_sum(simplex))
     [need to work through the implied geometry here]

* add lower/upper bound infinite or negative infinite values
  -- need is_pos_inf<T>(x) and is_neg_inf(x) tests and we
     only have isinf() which is either/or

* make sure all range errors are being caught
  -- math/matrix.hpp line 164
  -- STAN_NO_DEBUG property
  -- turn off checking if (NDEBUG || STAN_NO_DEBUG)
   -- impl from Marcus (Eigen):
      #ifndef STAN_NO_DEBUG
      #ifdef NDEBUG
      #define STAN_NO_DEBUG
      #endif
      #endif
 
     #ifdef STAN_NO_DEBUG 
     ..
   #endif

* make sure symmetry tests aren't too stringent for cov_matrix

* unpack Eigen/Boost and use just what we need a la RStan
  -- For Boost, do: 
  mkdir /tmp/boost_1.52.0
  find ${STAN_HOME}/src/ -name \*\.\[ch]pp -exec bcp --scan --boost=${STAN_HOME}/lib/boost_1.52.0 '{}' /tmp/boost_1.52.0/ \; &> /tmp/boost_1.52.0/bcp.log 

* poisson_log(y|alpha) = poisson(y|exp(alpha))

* change step_size = epsilon +/- epsilon_pm to
  step_size = min(C, epsilon + normal(0,sigma))

* remove (unsigned) long long instances in dump and error testing

* check that positive definiteness enforced for transformed params,
  transformed data

* replace Eigen .sum() with stan::math::sum() for auto-dif

* switch error checking for agrad::var matrix ops to
  convert to double-based matrix for check as in vectorized univariates

* Vectorize distributions
  - Allows vectorized inputs (but without partials calculated):
    univariate/continuous
    + chi_square
    + exponential
    + inv_chi_square
    + scaled_inv_chi_square
    + student_t
    + uniform
    + weibull
    univariate/discrete
    + binomial
    + beta_binomial (needs more testing)
    + hypergeometric
    + neg_binomial
    + poisson

* Ben's example: 
  matrix[3,2] ~ normal(matrix[3,1], matrix[1,2])
  this could recycle the first arg, a matrix shaped like a vector
  and the second arg, a matrix shaped like a roo vector.

* higher-order auto-dif
  -- chain rule:
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule#Higher_derivatives
  -- store adj_, adj2_ and adj3_ in new class 
     ++ stan::agrad::var3 with matching stan::agrad::vari3,
        and also var2, vari2
  -- chain() needs to compute them all in order
     ++ perhaps with chain1(), chain2(), and chain3(), with
        chain1() being the existing rule

* forward mode auto-dif
  - last revision 548: 
  - src/stan/agrad/ad.hpp
  - use for reasonably efficient Hessian calcs

* use expression template for value of += so that we could
    -- sum_expression& operator+=(sum_expression&, const var&);
    -- sum_expression(const var&);
    -- var(const sum_expression&);
       : create vectorized vari from sum_expression
  would require running lp__, etc. to be sum_expression to be useful
  without picking up signature
    -- var& operator+=(var&, const var&);

* templated functions returning var should go away in matrix

* add base class for stanc-generated models

* alternative distribution parameterizations
  - e.g., precision for (multi) normal
  - inverse_sqrt_gamma(...)

* handle covariance or correlation matrix of an AR1 process. 
  - If rho is the auto-regressive parameter, the entries of the 
    correlation matrix are powers of rho. And the precision matrix 
    is tridiagonal and known analytically. So, 
    it would be inefficient to plow that through 
    multivariate_normal_log().

* beta distro with mean plus "precision" params
  - beta_mean_log(theta|phi,kappa)
    = beta_log(theta|phi*kappa, (1-phi)*kappa)
  - Jacobian from:
        alpha <- phi * k
        beta  <- (1 - phi) * k
    determinant = k  (det [[a,b],[c,d]] = ad - bc)

* von Mises distribution (with location and concentration params?)
  -- requires modified/hyperbolic Bessel function of first kind of order 0 and 1

* Bessel functions
  - J:  Bessel function of first kind
    derivatives: http://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/BesselJ/20/01/
    signature:   T bessel(const T1& v, const T2& x);
    boost:  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/math_toolkit/special/bessel/bessel.html
  - I:  Modified (hyperbolic) Bessel function of first kind
    derivatives:  http://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/BesselI/20/01/
    signature:   T modified_bessel(const T1& v, const T& x);
    boost: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/math_toolkit/special/bessel/mbessel.html
  - we really (or at least also) want bessel_log() and modified_bessel_log()
  - and derivatives are really nasty for the concentration param if we
    don't auto-dif

* pow special cases
  - inv(x) = pow(x,-1) = 1/x
  - inv_square(x) = pow(x,-2)
  - inv_sqrt(x) = pow(x,-1/2)


* signum function
  int signum(real); 

* signed sqrt
  signed_sqrt(x) = -sqrt(-x) if x < 0
                 = sqrt(x)   if x > 0

* Skew normal distribution
  -- involves Phi() in its *density* function like
     the truncated normal
  -- hack for now using 
     normal_log(x|mu,sigma) + log(Phi(alpha * (x - mu) / sigma))

* More matrix functions from Eigen:
  - singular vectors in addition to values
    + nice to have (U,S,V) = svd(A) syntax for this
  - norm()
  - squaredNorm()
  - lpNorm<1>
  - lpNorm<Eigen::Infinity>

* z-score function
  - normalize sample to zero sample mean, unit sample variance

* cumulative distribution functions
  - boundary conditions at limits of support for cdfs
  - should we have the basic cdfs on the log scale?
  - need for truncated distros mostly
        foo_cdf_lb_log(L|...) == log(1 - foo_cdf(L|...))
                              == foo_ccdf_log(L|...)

        foo_cdf_ub_log(U|...) == log(foo_cdf(U|...))
                              == foo_cdf_log(U|...)

        foo_cdf_lub_log(L,U|...) == log(foo_cdf(U|...) - foo_cdf(L|...))
                                 == log_sum_exp(foo_cdf_log(U|...),                                 
                                                0, foo_ccdf_log(L|...))
  - to add:
     + calculation of cdf
     + two functions: 1) with templated policy, 2) with no policy,
        calling templated function with stan::math::default_policy()
     + TODO: test derivatives?
     + dox: add doxygen.
     + add to Stan Modeling Language Reference Manual function list


* matrix special products
  -- wrap_multiply(u,v) = u' * v * u
     ++ for square matrices,
        d/dx det(x' * A * x) = 2 det(x' * A * x) inv(x)'
        d/dx det(A) = det(A) inv(A)' = det(A) / A'


* sorting and interpolation
  -- rank(v,s): number of components of v less than v[s]
  -- ranked(v,s): s-th smallest component of v
  -- interp_ln(e,v1,v2) from BUGS (whatever for?)


* add general mixture model
  -- modeling language side
     simplex(K) lambda;
     vector(K) mu;
     vector(K) sigma;
     y ~ mixture(lambda,     // mixing
                 (mu,sigma), // param vecs
                 "normal");  // distro
  -- C++ impl
     std::vector<double> log_ps;
     for (k in 1:K)
       log_ps.push_back(log lambda[k] + normal_log(y,mu[k],sigma[k]));
     return log_sum_exp(log_ps);

* use our arena-based alloc as STL allocator for auto-dif
  - already doing this for dot products
  - http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/memory/allocator/
  - what do we need to do for dtor to work?
  -- need to take care of dynamic updates

* convert memory for vari to singleton 
  -- compile time config with flag for thread-safe / not

* make sure std::less<T*> and std::swap<T*> 
  does right thing for our types (like var and vari), as
  these are used in "algorithms".

* figure out way to have vari elements that are NOT on the stack
  - useful for numeric_limits<var>
  - stack_vari ==> vari ==> chainable
    local_vari ==> vari
    (stack_vari has operator new; local_vari uses dtor?)

* allow Stan to read data in multiple formats (particulary CSV)
  -- and allow multiple files to be specified for single run

* memcpy faster than copy ctor and operator= for var?

* remove dependence of prob functions like normal_log on agrad, 
  Eigen, etc.  [may not be easy or worth the effort]

* unfold logistic and linear regression auto-difs

* allow user-defined extensions

* dump format parser to handle:
  - integers with scientific notation
  - NaN, Inf, -Inf  (written just like that)
  - length one arrays read in like scalars

* make sure still possible to use header-only ad

* add scalar subtraction to match scalar addition of vectors
  (to distribute over values)

* Stan safe mode to compile BUGS/JAGS-compliant models
  - allows more error checking and optimization

* add STAN_NO_DEBUG option to turn off bounds checking

* add checks for matrix sizes in matrix ops

* Speed up compilation
  -- More precompilation into object files.
     Pros:  faster compiles
     Cons:  it makes the code more difficult to manage
            and less flexible by requiring redundancy 
            and preinstation of templates
  -- More targeted imports.  
     Pros:  faster compiles because less code to read
     Cons:  defeats precompiled headers

* some kind of multi-threaded timer to monitor Stan

* discrete samplers
  -- for special block, use main log_prob to evaluate
     conditional probs up to proportion
  -- Gibbs for small outcome sets 
  -- Gibbs for non-ordinal, non-count params
     ++ e.g., LDA topic samples
  -- Slice for larger ones
     ++ adapt?
  -- what about mulitnomial with constraints?
     ++ metropolis?

* more general built-in initializations
  -  normal or student-t w. params
  -  or even set uniform boundaries
  -  e.g., uniform(-1,1), normal(0,1), t(0,2.5)

* cross-chain sharing of adaptation parameters, which should
  be similar across chains if all is going well

* set mass matrix for sampling parameters [& percolate to RStan/cmd]
  -- need diagonal to be efficient
  -- could allow general matrix

* ongoing code cleanup
  - const declarations wherever possible
  - more care with size_t, etc.
  - privatize everything possible
  - remove unnecessary dependencies/includes
  - convert for loops with size bounds to appropriate iterators
  - templatize std::vector/Eigen functions where possible
  - reduce code dup in gm/generator

* revise API doc for doxygen

* error handling for special functions
  - math and agrad
  - matrix sizes
  - how to configure std::log(), etc.?

* Watanabe's WAIC: Widely applicable information criterion

* implicit functions with derivatives (iterative solver)

* refactor finite diff derivative calcs to functor
      template <class F, typename S>
      bool finite_diffs(const vector<S>& x,
                        const F& f,
                        vector<S>& df_dx);

* Speed test pass-by-const-ref and pass-by-val for stan::agrad::var

* break out body of error handling to get isnan if/else inlined

* "non-parametric" models
  - approximate a la BUGS vol 3
  - merge reversible jump and HMC somehow?

* allow references in Stan language to make it easy to
  set eigenvalues + eigenvectors (or singular vals + vecs)
  in one call

* optimization API
  - functor-based concept design with templates 
  - easily pluggable with log prob in model for MAP 

* add adaptive slice sampling
  -- will it fit into adaptive_sampler in mcmc?
  -- goal to minimize number of function evals
     ++ step out: linear, with log step-in
     ++ doubling: exp, log step-in (but reject & more evals)

* adapt low-order approximation to an actual mass matrix

* add DE and/or DREAM extensions as sampler
  -- if I (Bob) understand Matt correctly, we can just
     concatenate particle samples to calculate ESS

* online R-hat (split R-hat?) monitoring + means, etc.
  -- need monitor interface like JAGS?

* elim stan/maths/matrix lib by adding implicit ctor
  for Matrix<var,...> based on Matrix<double,...>

* blocking updates on parameters
  - only update subset of parameters
  - specify blocks in program?
  - allow Gibbs on some variables
  - split HMC into blocks (aka batches)
  - in the limit do conditional with HMC!

* stepwise debugger for Stan
  - print adaptation params
  - print gradients
  - just a mode on command to print more out per sample?
  - ideally link runtime errors back to lines of Stan code




Modeling Language
======================================================================

* allow array modifiers on types as well as variables
  -- int[4] x;
  -- int x[4];
  -- change all the syntax or allow both?

* add ragged array types
  -- data { int x[,]; } 
     for a possibly ragged array x
  -- easiest for data
     ++ buffer values until get postfix dims
  -- would also work for transformed data because sets
  -- would need a way to declare raggedness for params
     in order to read them in from array
  -- parameters { int x[ns]; }
     might be used if ns is an int array of sizes
  -- how to generalize this?
 --  int<lower=0> N;          // number of subjects
      int<lower=1> n_obs[N];   // num observations for subject n in 1:N
      cov_matrix[n_obs] c;     // cov matrices for subject n in 1:N
      *  The intent of the notation is that c[n] for n in 1:N
         is an (n_obs[n] x n_obs[n]) covariance matrix.
      * This notation lets us do a single final layer of
         raggedness and could apply anywhere there's a size.  So
            real y[n_obs];
         is a 2D ragged array structure where y[n] is a n_obs[n]-vector

* get line numbers into error messages

* compiler for R's linear model notation

* generalize vector ops to conforming matrices 
  -- need to work out whether we can do this and
     still preserve type inference;  e.g., x * x'
     may still be a matrix even if x is a row vector.

* integer subtypes
  - non_negative_int = int[1,]
  - natural = int[0,]
  - boolean = int[0,1]
  - categorical(K) = int[1,K]

* real subtypes
  - probability = real[0,1]
  - correlation = real[-1,1]
  - non_negative_real = real[0,inf]
  - non_positive_real = real[-inf,0]

* matrix slice and assign
  - index m
  - range-indexes: implicit ellision == :, a:, :b, a:b
  - e.g., matrix[M,N] m; vector(M) v;  m[,1] = v;

* conditional expressions
  - binary operators on int or double
    + bool op(int,int);
    + bool op(double,double); // allows promotion
    + usual comparisons:  ==,  !=,  <=,  <,  >=,  >
  - operators on conditions
    (!cond),  (cond && cond),  (cond || cond),  (cond)
  - ternary op: cond ? x : y

* conditional statements
  - if <cond> statement else if <cond> statement ... else statement;
  - while <cond> statement;
  - repeat <statement> until <cond>;
  - for (<statement>; <cond>; <statement>) statement;
  - Marcus's hack:
    if (a > b) {...}
    ==
    for  (i in 1:int_step(a-b)) {...}

* for-each statement
  - foreach (<var> : <list-expression>) <statement>;
  
* multi-returns and array literals
  - (a,b,c) = foo();  // function returns array
  - (m,n,p) = (1,2,3);   // (1,2,3) is array literal

* matrix and array notation:
- The syntax is pretty simple modulo size conformance
  checking.  Here's the BNF:
    matrix_expression ::= '[' matrix_row (';' matrix_row)* ']'
    matrix_row ::= expression*
  The idea is that the expressions are laid out in a row
  and a ';' indicates to start a new row.
  The basic cases are as follows:
    [1 2 3]    : row_vector[3]
    [1 2 3; 4 5 6]  : matrix[2,3]
  Use transpose to create vectors:
    [1 2 3]'   : vector[3]
  And allow more complex things in a matrix_row in the BNF, 
  such as a sequence of vectors:
    [[1 2 3]' [4 5 6]']  : matrix[3,2]
  In general, we could allow matrices, too:
    [[1 2; 3 4] [5 6; 7 8]] : matrix[4,2]
  This would keep nesting in the obvious ways.
- We need some way to call out arrays and allow higher
  dimensions, so we can't overload the same syntax.
  I like the following:
     array ::= 'a' '(' expression* ')'
  Examples are:
    a(1,2,3)   :  int[3]
    a(1.0,2,3)  :  real[3]
    a(a(1,2,3), a(4,5,6)) : int[2,3]
    a([1 2 3], [4 5 6]) : row_vector[3][2]
  But it brings up type inference issues, because
  a(1,2,3) is int[3], not real[3].   We could 
  add primitive 1D-array syntax such as:
           | 'ints' '(' int_expression* ')'
           | 'reals' '(' real_expression* ')'


* multiple declarations
  - e.g., double a, b, c[N];

* declare and assign
  - e.g., double x <- 5.0;
    double b[5];
    double a[5] <- b; // odd, eh?
    simplex(5)[2] c <- ... // wouldn't be obvious to support

* tuple types for multiple returns (U,S,V) <- svd(A)
  -- different than array literals as may have different typed
  components

* introduce transforms into the Stan language that have the same
  effect as the declarations, e.g.
    parameters {  real x; }
    transformed_parameters { real(0,1) y; y <- lub(y,0,1,lp__); }

* extensions
  - declare file paths to #include
  - declare namespace usings
  - declare function sigs for parser  
    ++ if happens up front, in time for body parsing

* ragged arrays
  - ready to use with vec<...<vec<x>...> pattern
  - not clear how to declare (follow C?)
  -- example on p. 8 of 
     http://www.jstatsoft.org/v36/c01/paper/
     involving ragged param arays for graded response model

* subroutines
  - user-defined functions in StanGM
  - user-defined densities (how much to require?)
  - interpreted conditionally based on block?

* compound op-assigns in StanGM
  +<-, *<-, etc.  (ugly, ugly, ugly syntax; cf., +=, *=, etc.)

* warnings
  - a <- foo(theta) if LHS contains variable: overwrite var
  - a ~ foo(theta)  if LHS is complex expression: need Jacobian
  - check each parameter shows up on LHS of ~ at least once

* power operations
  - matrix power:    A^n
  - matrix elementwise power:  A.^x
  - regular old real power: x^y

* allow normal_log(y|0,1) as synonym for normal_log(y,0,1)

* Allow normal_log<true> and normal_log<false> to be accessed
  directly

* add a parameter initialization block
  - fill in values not given randomly or report error?
  - needs randomization

* new types
  -- lower triangular matrix
     ++ strict lower triangular matrix
     ++ covariance matrix cholesky factor matrix
  -- diagonal matrix
  -- symmetric matrix
     [need to treat like others and just test at end]
  -- point on hypersphere
     ++ like simplex, but 2-norm is 1, rather than 1-norm
     ++ trickier for generating last point as the sign
        remains underdetermined

* positive-definiteness-preserving operations
  -- rescale strictly positive
      

* unit matrix function unit_matrix(K)
  -- return var or just double?  
  -- users shouldn't use this to assign to transformed param

* constants for integer max and min values

* random generation
  -- generated quantities block
     ++ use sampling notation  y ~ normal(0,1);
        to set y to normal_random(0,1) draw
  -- transformed data block
     ++ could also use sampling notation
     ++ issue of whether to share across chains or not
  -- transformed parameter block
     ++ possible, but can't use sampling notation
  -- need to push RNG through to whatever calls necessary
  -- if we add to models, etc., should derivatives just
     be the same as basic so that
        y[n] <- random_normal(mu,sigma);
     gets same grad as:
        y[n] ~ normal(mu,sigma);
   
* truncations need to be vectorized, too!



Build
======================================================================

* remove writes into Stan directory itself

* set up make to work from directory other than STAN_HOME
  - pass in arg?  environment var?


Testing
======================================================================

* agrad distribution tests misuse the autodif stack and may result in
  unexpected behavior now. Need to fix.
  
* build unit tests from the BUGS models that just check
  the gradients are right (this'll also cover parsing and
  being able to fire up the models)

* auto testing of sampler
  - Cook/Gelman/Rubin-style interval tests
  - needs effective sample size calc to bound intervals
  - needs simulated parameters to test estimators
  - push ESS "measurement error" through the interval tests

* more matrix tests (for all ops w. gradients)

* benchmarks
  - agrad vs. RAD/Sacado, CppAD, ... ?
  - stan vs. MCMCpack, R, BUGS, JAGS, OpenBUGS, ...

* profile running models w. various operations

* complete math robustness and limits review
  - want domain boundaries to be right (usually
    -inf, 0 and inf, etc.)

* more diagnostics during warmup of where epsilon is going

* speed measurement
  - to converge
  - time per effective sample once converged
  - time to 4 chains at 25 ESS/chain, rHat < 1.1 for all
    parameters theta[k] and theta[k]*theta[k]
  - discarding first half of samples too many if fast to converge

* Speed vs. JAGS
  -- run JAGS compiled with g++ -O3
  --  Look at models where Stan performs well
      e.g.  logistic or linear regression w. Cauchy and Normal prior
     - varying model shapes (step up exponentially)
        + number of data items
        + number of parameters
        + correlation of parameters (multi-variate Cauchy or Normal)
        + interaction of params (? need this with correlation ?)
        + conjugate vs. non-conjugate priors
           (well and misspecified -- more stats than speed issue)
  -- Single threaded
  -- Run 4 chains (each of same length) of each system (Stan and JAGS)
      - diffuse initializations (hand generate for each)
      - until convergence by split R-hat (all params under 1.05)
      - total (across all chains) ESS is > 100 (and < 150 or something?)
        (e.g., 25/25/25/25, or 15/35/20/30)
      - report time in effective samples/second for min ESS parameter
  -- Report multiple runs of each (10? 100?)
      - histograms/densities or mean/sd of multiple runs
      - how much will it vary by seed
  -- Throw away first half of each run?
      - to start, until split convergence/sample speeds
  -- Ideally, measure:
      - time to converge to equilibrium
      - ESS rate at equilibrium


RStan / PStan / MStan / Command Line
======================================================================

* (Rstan) I/O functions to read in the output produced by
  command-line Stan (or write-to file RStan)

* (Rstan) expose transform and inverse transform functions
  -- danger is that the transforms may change over time

* (Rstan) propagate debug error messages to R
  see: http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rcpp-devel/2011-October/003006.html

* (cmd) more RStan like behavior
  -- add --chains=N argument to command-line to run multiple chains
     and write into one or more files (already done in RStan)
  -- new command to read .csv files into chains object and print out
     summary (related to a single command)

* (PStan) interface to Python

* (MStan) interface to MATLAB

* (RStan/cmd) --functions option in stanc to print out
  signatures of all available functions for current version

* (R/cmd) Convergence monitoring of higher moments
  -- at least squared for variance, which being non-linear
     function, isn't same as convergence of basic param

* (R/cmd) add chain ID to output as first column

* (R/cmd) add draw ID to output as second column
  -- plus need something for DE/DREAM with ensemble

* (R/cmd) track rejection rate by testing equality of
  samples; e.g., sum(a[1:(N-1)] == a[2:N])

* (R/cmd) restart from where command left off a la R2jags
  - this will require writing dump output or a converter
    for the CSV output to dump output
  - easiest to save unconstrained params
  - also need to save adaptation states, etc.
  - need to save seed and type of randomizer

* auto convergence monitoring -- just keep doubling (or other ratio)
  - doubling reduces total calc to at most double the end
  - easy to monitor averages and variances online using accumulators

* (R/cmd) allow configuration of target reject rate in step-size adaptation

* (cmd) write analyze command to read in output and do analysis 
  a la print in RStan

* (R/cmd) write model text into output in a comment

* (R/cmd) catch +inf, -inf values of unconstrained params and let
  users know they have an improper posterior

* (R) catch errors/exceptions generated by Stan and trap
  so they don't percolate through to R

* (R) group dimensions of multivariate params on output plots

* (R/cmd) have output digits depend on se?

* (R/cmd) check initial vals and gradients for finiteness and
  return error message if not

* (R) switch n_chains to chains

* (R/cmd) order of plots/output variables should match declaration

* (R) variable-at-time traceplot
  -- traceplot(fit) -- array of traceplots for all vals (truncated)
  -- traceplot(fit,"a") -- array of traceplots for a (truncated)
  -- traceplot(fit,"a[5,3]") -- traceplot for a[5,3]

* (R) structured data access 
  - via getters
  - attach.stan(?)  [does this need a corresponding detach.stan()?]


Web Pages
======================================================================

Manuals
======================================================================

* Fix 0--(N-1) range for categorical example and in doc for categorical

* Talk about index order and read order for matrix[I,J] a[K];
  -- in section on arrays in language reference
  -- in section on I/O
  -- example:
     real x[I,J,K];
     matrix[J,K] m[I];

    for (k in 1:K)
      for (j in 1:J)
        for (i in 1:I)
          x[i,j,k] = next...

* Stan's default is to use uniform inits between [-2,2] 
  on the unconstrained params.  For bounded params, that amounts
  to a range of (inv_logit(-2), inv_logit(2)) = (.12,.88), which
  is the central 80% interval.

  For positive params, that amounts to sampling between
  (exp(-2),exp(2)).

  For unconstrained params, sampling is between (-2,2).

  Plot these out because they're non-linear.

* transforms a la Matt, at least for all the normal-based cases
  we know of

* chapter on change of variables in the user guide

* more explanation of overall output analysis
  -- more on using generated quantities for posterior
     + predictive simulation (waiting for RNGs)
     + event probability calculations
  -- exp(lp__) propto posterior
  ?? do we do this in R or what?

* mention that discrete output functions like floor()
  lose gradient information

* copy FAQ into manual appendix (and onto web?)

* mention that even if you aren't interested in all the parameters,
  you do want to save them to monitor convergence and ESS

* provide mathematical definitions of all the special functions

* document version numbering: major.minor.patch
  - patch: just bug fixes, no behavior change
  - minor: some new functions, backward compatible
  - major: big changes, breaking backward compatibility

* add prior to getting started examples in doc

* use "draw" for a single parameter value and "sample" for
  multiples, with "sample of size 1000" or "1000 draws".

* drop Lucida console font section (?) or link Bigelow and Holmes

* break out sampler chapter in doc to describe multiple samplers

* performance tips
  - compute once and re-use if possible
  - pull out constants from loops
  - pull out terms from looped probabilities

* add example calculating log likelihood for DIC
  - how to specify likelihood terms in model?

* add example on individual log likelihoods for WAIC
  - how to specify individual likelihood terms in model?

   generated quantities {
    for (i in 1:I) 
      for (j in 1:J) 
        ll_y[i,j] <- normal_log(y[i,j]...)


* Doc the generated C++ model class

* Add an Index

* Description of reverse-mode auto-dif or too C++-like?

  and to allow developers to work from latest stable version

* appoint a commit manager


Models
======================================================================

* convergence diagnostics
    verboseEvolve:
      Evolve the current state by one half momentum step, one full
      position step, and then one half momentum step, displaying H, and
      ( \Delta H / epsilon^{2} ) at each update.  The idea is that if
      the leapfrog is working properly then you should see the
      cancellation of errors (some error in one direction, then lots of
      error in the other direction, then error in the first direction
      again to cancel the bulk of the difference).
  checkIntError: 
      Evolve the current state by a given number of iterations,
      displaying H and ( \Delta H / epsilon^{2} ) at each update so
      that you can see if the error is only slowly increasing or
      straight up diverging for the given evolution parameters.
  saveTrajectory:
      Evolve the current state through a single trajectory, saving each
      update to a file.  This way you can plot the entire trajectory and
      check it visually for problems (helpful in diagnosing divergences,
      bad step-sizes, etc).
  plotSamples:
      Save the proposed sample, proposed potential, and acceptance
      probability in the chain, then display the visual diagnostics
      we've discussed before, namely histograms of each marginal
      distribution for samples with p(accept) < 0.1 and p(accept) > 0.9.
      For NUTS you'd have to play around with this a bit -- Matt had
      recommended looking at the average acceptance probability across
      the entire chain, but I'm not sure which sample you'd plot in that
      case.  You'd do just as well plotting each step along the
      trajectory along with what its acceptance probability would be,
      provided the storage of all those samples doesn't cause issues.

* unit K-hyperball complement for stationary AR(K) parameters
  - what should the prior be?

* user model library
  - something we don't have to get too involved vetting
  - ideally things hard to do with other systems
  - or illustrate the unusual parts of our modeling language

* Online books with models based on BUGS:
  http://stat-athens.aueb.gr/~jbn/winbugs_book/
  http://137.227.242.23/pubanalysis/kerybook/

* deal with autocorrelation model params where require
  all roots of 1 - SUM_i rho[i]**i to be within unit
  complex circle

* show how to code undirected graphical models in Stan
