<b>Stan</b> is a C++ package providing

* full Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC),
* approximate Bayesian inference using automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI), and
* penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using L-BFGS optimization.

It is built on top of the [Stan Math library](https://github.com/stan-dev/math), which provides

* a full first- and higher-order automatic differentiation library based on C++ template overloads, and
* a supporting fully-templated matrix, linear algebra, and probability special function library.

There are interfaces available in R, Python, MATLAB, Julia, Stata, Mathematica, and for the command line.
