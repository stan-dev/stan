## Contributing Code

The instructions for contributors including the Git process, the testing process, and the Stan coding standards, see the top-level Wiki:

* [Stan Developer Process](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki)

## Stan Manual Issues

If you would like to make a suggestion for fixing a typo or unclear part of the manual, please make a comment on the currently open next manual issue (it will be numbered by current release followed by `++`) and we will fix it in the next release after the current release:

* [Next Manual Issue](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3ABug%20%22next%20manual%22%20label%3ADocumentation)

This is easier for us than having to deal with a typo pull request, though we will gladly take those, too.

## Submitting an Issue
